<hr class="r15" />

<p class="noindent">The character and credit of the British Army must
chiefly depend upon the zeal and ardour by which
all who enter into its service are animated, and
consequently it is of the highest importance that any
measure calculated to excite the spirit of emulation,
by which alone great and gallant actions are achieved,
should be adopted.</p>

<p>Nothing can more fully tend to the accomplishment
of this desirable object than a full display of the noble
deeds with which the Military History of our country
abounds. To hold forth these bright examples to
the imitation of the youthful soldier, and thus to
incite him to emulate the meritorious conduct of those
who have preceded him in their honorable career,
are among the motives that have given rise to the
present publication.</p>

<p>The operations of the British Troops are, indeed,
announced in the “London Gazette,” from whence
they are transferred into the public prints: the
achievements of our armies are thus made known at
the time of their occurrence, and receive the tribute<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_iv"></a>[iv]</span>
of praise and admiration to which they are entitled.
On extraordinary occasions, the Houses of Parliament
have been in the habit of conferring on the Commanders,
and the Officers and Troops acting under
their orders, expressions of approbation and of thanks
for their skill and bravery; and these testimonials,
confirmed by the high honour of their Sovereign’s
approbation, constitute the reward which the soldier
most highly prizes.</p>

<p>It has not, however, until late years, been the practice
(which appears to have long prevailed in some of
the Continental armies) for British Regiments to keep
regular records of their services and achievements.
Hence some difficulty has been experienced in obtaining,
particularly from the old Regiments, an authentic
account of their origin and subsequent services.</p>

<p>This defect will now be remedied, in consequence
of His Majesty having been pleased to command
that every Regiment shall, in future, keep a full and
ample record of its services at home and abroad.</p>

<p>From the materials thus collected, the country
will henceforth derive information as to the difficulties
and privations which chequer the career of those who
embrace the military profession. In Great Britain,
where so large a number of persons are devoted to
the active concerns, of agriculture, manufactures,
and commerce, and where these pursuits have, for so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_v"></a>[v]</span>
long a period, been undisturbed by the <em>presence of
war</em>, which few other countries have escaped, comparatively
little is known of the vicissitudes of active
service and of the casualties of climate, to which,
even during peace, the British Troops are exposed in
every part of the globe, with little or no interval of
repose.</p>

<p>In their tranquil enjoyment of the blessings which
the country derives from the industry and the enterprise
of the agriculturist and the trader, its happy
inhabitants may be supposed not often to reflect on
the perilous duties of the soldier and the sailor,&mdash;on
their sufferings,&mdash;and on the sacrifice of valuable life,
by which so many national benefits are obtained and
preserved.</p>

<p>The conduct of the British Troops, their valour,
and endurance, have shone conspicuously under great
and trying difficulties; and their character has been
established in Continental warfare by the irresistible
spirit with which they have effected debarkations in
spite of the most formidable opposition, and by the
gallantry and steadiness with which they have maintained
their advantages against superior numbers.</p>

<p>In the official Reports made by the respective Commanders,
ample justice has generally been done to
the gallant exertions of the Corps employed; but
the details of their services and of acts of individual<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span>
bravery can only be fully given in the Annals of the
various Regiments.</p>

<p>These Records are now preparing for publication,
under His Majesty’s special authority, by Mr.
<span class="smcap">Richard Cannon</span>, Principal Clerk of the Adjutant-General’s
Office; and while the perusal of them cannot
fail to be useful and interesting to military men
of every rank, it is considered that they will also
afford entertainment and information to the general
reader, particularly to those who may have served in
the Army, or who have relatives in the Service.</p>

<p>There exists in the breasts of most of those who
have served, or are serving, in the Army, an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Esprit
de Corps</i>&mdash;an attachment to everything belonging
to their Regiment; to such persons a narrative of
the services of their own Corps cannot fail to prove
interesting. Authentic accounts of the actions of
the great, the valiant, the loyal, have always been
of paramount interest with a brave and civilized
people. Great Britain has produced a race of heroes
who, in moments of danger and terror, have stood
“firm as the rocks of their native shore:” and when
half the world has been arrayed against them, they
have fought the battles of their Country with unshaken
fortitude. It is presumed that a record of
achievements in war,&mdash;victories so complete and surprising,
gained by our countrymen, our brothers,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vii"></a>[vii]</span>
our fellow-citizens in arms,&mdash;a record which revives
the memory of the brave, and brings their gallant
deeds before us,&mdash;will certainly prove acceptable to

<p class="p2 noindent">The natives of Britain have, at all periods, been
celebrated for innate courage and unshaken firmness,
and the national superiority of the British troops
over those of other countries has been evinced in
the midst of the most imminent perils. History contains
so many proofs of extraordinary acts of bravery,
that no doubts can be raised upon the facts which
are recorded. It must therefore be admitted, that
the distinguishing feature of the British soldier is
<span class="smcap">Intrepidity</span>. This quality was evinced by the
inhabitants of England when their country was
invaded by Julius Cæsar with a Roman army, on
which occasion the undaunted Britons rushed into
the sea to attack the Roman soldiers as they descended
from their ships; and, although their discipline
and arms were inferior to those of their
adversaries, yet their fierce and dauntless bearing
intimidated the flower of the Roman troops, including
Cæsar’s favourite tenth legion. Their arms
consisted of spears, short swords, and other weapons
of rude construction. They had chariots, to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x"></a>[x]</span>
axles of which were fastened sharp pieces of iron
resembling scythe-blades, and infantry in long
chariots resembling waggons, who alighted and
fought on foot, and for change of ground, pursuit
or retreat, sprang into the chariot and drove off
with the speed of cavalry. These inventions were,
however, unavailing against Cæsar’s legions: in
the course of time a military system, with discipline
and subordination, was introduced, and
British courage, being thus regulated, was exerted
to the greatest advantage; a full development of
the national character followed, and it shone forth
in all its native brilliancy.</p>

<p>The military force of the Anglo-Saxons consisted
principally of infantry: Thanes, and other men of
property, however, fought on horseback. The
infantry were of two classes, heavy and light.
The former carried large shields armed with spikes,
long broad swords and spears; and the latter were
armed with swords or spears only. They had also
men armed with clubs, others with battle-axes and
javelins.</p>

<p>The feudal troops established by William the
Conqueror consisted (as already stated in the Introduction
to the Cavalry) almost entirely of horse;
but when the warlike barons and knights, with their
trains of tenants and vassals, took the field, a proportion
of men appeared on foot, and, although
these were of inferior degree, they proved stout-hearted
Britons of stanch fidelity. When stipendiary
troops were employed, infantry always constituted
a considerable portion of the military force;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xi"></a>[xi]</span>
and this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">arme</i> has since acquired, in every quarter
of the globe, a celebrity never exceeded by the
armies of any nation at any period.</p>

<p>The weapons carried by the infantry, during the
several reigns succeeding the Conquest, were bows
and arrows, half-pikes, lances, halberds, various
kinds of battle-axes, swords, and daggers. Armour
was worn on the head and body, and in course of
time the practice became general for military men
to be so completely cased in steel, that it was
almost impossible to slay them.</p>

<p>The introduction of the use of gunpowder in the
destructive purposes of war, in the early part of the
fourteenth century, produced a change in the arms
and equipment of the infantry-soldier. Bows and
arrows gave place to various kinds of fire-arms, but
British archers continued formidable adversaries;
and, owing to the inconvenient construction and imperfect
bore of the fire-arms when first introduced,
a body of men, well trained in the use of the bow
from their youth, was considered a valuable acquisition
to every army, even as late as the sixteenth
century.</p>

<p>During a great part of the reign of Queen Elizabeth
each company of infantry usually consisted of
men armed five different ways; in every hundred
men forty were “<em>men-at-arms</em>,” and sixty “<em>shot</em>;”
the “men-at-arms” were ten halberdiers, or battle-axe
men, and thirty pikemen; and the “shot” were
twenty archers, twenty musketeers, and twenty
harquebusiers, and each man carried, besides his
principal weapon, a sword and dagger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xii"></a>[xii]</span></p>

<p>Companies of infantry varied at this period in
numbers from 150 to 300 men; each company had
a colour or ensign, and the mode of formation recommended
by an English military writer (Sir John
Smithe) in 1590 was:&mdash;the colour in the centre of
the company guarded by the halberdiers; the pikemen
in equal proportions, on each flank of the
halberdiers: half the musketeers on each flank of
the pikes; half the archers on each flank of the musketeers,
and the harquebusiers (whose arms were
much lighter than the muskets then in use) in equal
proportions on each flank of the company for skirmishing.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
It was customary to unite a number of companies
into one body, called a <span class="smcap">Regiment</span>, which
frequently amounted to three thousand men: but
each company continued to carry a colour. Numerous
improvements were eventually introduced in the
construction of fire-arms, and, it having been found
impossible to make armour proof against the muskets
then in use (which carried a very heavy ball) without
its being too weighty for the soldier, armour was
gradually laid aside by the infantry in the seventeenth
century: bows and arrows also fell into disuse,
and the infantry were reduced to two classes,
viz.: <em>musketeers</em>, armed with matchlock muskets,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiii"></a>[xiii]</span>
swords, and daggers; and <em>pikemen</em>, armed with pikes
from fourteen to eighteen feet long, and swords.</p>

<p>In the early part of the seventeenth century
Gustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden, reduced the
strength of regiments to 1000 men. He caused the
gunpowder, which had heretofore been carried in
flasks, or in small wooden bandoliers, each containing
a charge, to be made up into cartridges, and
carried in pouches; and he formed each regiment
into two wings of musketeers, and a centre division
of pikemen. He also adopted the practice of forming
four regiments into a brigade; and the number
of colours was afterwards reduced to three in each
regiment. He formed his columns so compactly that
his infantry could resist the charge of the celebrated
Polish horsemen and Austrian cuirassiers; and his
armies became the admiration of other nations. His
mode of formation was copied by the English,
French, and other European states; but so great
was the prejudice in favour of ancient customs, that
all his improvements were not adopted until near a
century afterwards.</p>

<p>In 1664 King Charles II. raised a corps for sea-service,
styled the Admiral’s regiment. In 1678
each company of 100 men usually consisted of 30
pikemen, 60 musketeers, and 10 men armed with
light firelocks. In this year the King added a company
of men armed with hand grenades to each of
the old British regiments, which was designated the
“grenadier company.” Daggers were so contrived
as to fit in the muzzles of the muskets, and bayonets,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiv"></a>[xiv]</span>
similar to those at present in use, were adopted about
twenty years afterwards.</p>

<p>An Ordnance regiment was raised in 1685, by
order of King James II., to guard the artillery, and
was designated the Royal Fusiliers (now 7th Foot).
This corps, and the companies of grenadiers, did
not carry pikes.</p>

<p>King William III. incorporated the Admiral’s
regiment in the second Foot Guards, and raised
two Marine regiments for sea-service. During the
war in this reign, each company of infantry (excepting
the fusiliers and grenadiers) consisted of 14
pikemen and 46 musketeers; the captains carried
pikes; lieutenants, partisans; ensigns, half-pikes;
and serjeants, halberds. After the peace in 1697 the
Marine regiments were disbanded, but were again
formed on the breaking out of the war in 1702.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>During the reign of Queen Anne the pikes were
laid aside, and every infantry soldier was armed
with a musket, bayonet, and sword; the grenadiers
ceased, about the same period, to carry hand grenades;
and the regiments were directed to lay aside
their third colour: the corps of Royal Artillery was
first added to the Army in this reign.</p>

<p>About the year 1745, the men of the battalion
companies of infantry ceased to carry swords; during<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xv"></a>[xv]</span>
the reign of George II. light companies were added
to infantry regiments; and in 1764 a Board of
General Officers recommended that the grenadiers
should lay aside their swords, as that weapon had
never been used during the Seven Years’ War. Since
that period the arms of the infantry soldier have been
limited to the musket and bayonet.</p>

<p>The arms and equipment of the British Troops have
seldom differed materially, since the Conquest, from
those of other European states; and in some respects
the arming has, at certain periods, been allowed to
be inferior to that of the nations with whom they
have had to contend; yet, under this disadvantage,
the bravery and superiority of the British infantry
have been evinced on very many and most trying
occasions, and splendid victories have been gained
over very superior numbers.</p>

<p>Great Britain has produced a race of lion-like
champions who have dared to confront a host of
foes, and have proved themselves valiant with any
arms. At <em>Crecy</em>, King Edward III., at the head of
about 30,000 men, defeated, on the 26th of August,
1346, Philip King of France, whose army is said to
have amounted to 100,000 men; here British valour
encountered veterans of renown:&mdash;the King of Bohemia,
the King of Majorca, and many princes and
nobles were slain, and the French army was routed
and cut to pieces. Ten years afterwards, Edward
Prince of Wales, who was designated the Black
Prince, defeated, at <em>Poictiers</em>, with 14,000 men,
a French army of 60,000 horse, besides infantry,
and took John I., King of France, and his son<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvi"></a>[xvi]</span>
Philip, prisoners. On the 25th of October, 1415,
King Henry V., with an army of about 13,000
men, although greatly exhausted by marches, privations,
and sickness, defeated, at <em>Agincourt</em>, the
Constable of France, at the head of the flower of
the French nobility and an army said to amount to
60,000 men, and gained a complete victory.</p>

<p>During the seventy years’ war between the United
Provinces of the Netherlands and the Spanish monarchy,
which commenced in 1578 and terminated
in 1648, the British infantry in the service of the
States-General were celebrated for their unconquerable
spirit and firmness;<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and in the thirty
years’ War between the Protestant Princes and the
Emperor of Germany, the British Troops in the service
of Sweden and other states were celebrated for
deeds of heroism.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> In the wars of Queen Anne,
the fame of the British army under the great
<span class="smcap">Marlborough</span> was spread throughout the world;
and if we glance at the achievements performed
within the memory of persons now living, there is
abundant proof that the Britons of the present age
are not inferior to their ancestors in the qualities<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvii"></a>[xvii]</span>
which constitute good soldiers. Witness the deeds
of the brave men, of whom there are many now
surviving, who fought in Egypt in 1801, under the
brave Abercromby, and compelled the French army,
which had been vainly styled <em>Invincible</em>, to evacuate
that country; also the services of the gallant
Troops during the arduous campaigns in the Peninsula,
under the immortal <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>; and the
determined stand made by the British Army at
Waterloo, where Napoleon Bonaparte, who had
long been the inveterate enemy of Great Britain,
and had sought and planned her destruction by
every means he could devise, was compelled to
leave his vanquished legions to their fate, and to
place himself at the disposal of the British Government.
These achievements, with others of recent
dates in the distant climes of India, prove that the
same valour and constancy which glowed in the
breasts of the heroes of Crecy, Poictiers, Agincourt,
Blenheim, and Ramilies, continue to animate the
Britons of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>The British Soldier is distinguished for a robust
and muscular frame,&mdash;intrepidity which no danger
can appal,&mdash;unconquerable spirit and resolution,&mdash;patience
in fatigue and privation, and cheerful obedience
to his superiors. These qualities,&mdash;united with
an excellent system of order and discipline to regulate
and give a skilful direction to the energies and
adventurous spirit of the hero, and a wise selection
of officers of superior talent to command, whose
presence inspires confidence,&mdash;have been the leading
causes of the splendid victories gained by the British<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xviii"></a>[xviii]</span>
arms.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The fame of the deeds of the past and
present generations in the various battle-fields where
the robust sons of Albion have fought and conquered,
surrounds the British arms with a halo of glory;
these achievements will live in the page of history to
the end of time.</p>

<p>The records of the several regiments will be found
to contain a detail of facts of an interesting character,
connected with the hardships, sufferings, and gallant
exploits of British soldiers in the various parts of the
world, where the calls of their Country and the commands
of their Sovereign have required them to
proceed in the execution of their duty, whether in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xix"></a>[xix]</span>
active continental operations, or in maintaining colonial
territories in distant and unfavourable climes.</p>

<p>The superiority of the British infantry has been
pre-eminently set forth in the wars of six centuries,
and admitted by the greatest commanders which
Europe has produced. The formations and movements
of this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">arme</i>, as at present practised, while
they are adapted to every species of warfare, and to
all probable situations and circumstances of service,
are well suited to show forth the brilliancy of military
tactics calculated upon mathematical and scientific
principles. Although the movements and evolutions
have been copied from the continental armies, yet
various improvements have from time to time been
introduced, to ensure that simplicity and celerity by
which the superiority of the national military character
is maintained. The rank and influence which
Great Britain has attained among the nations of the
world have in a great measure been purchased by
the valour of the Army, and to persons who have the
welfare of their country at heart the records of the
several regiments cannot fail to prove interesting.</p>

necessary by the superiority which the enemy had acquired, and
which had materially impaired the efficiency of the troops, many disadvantages
were to be encountered. These have all been surmounted by

<p class="noindent">In the commencement of the eighteenth century,
the British Monarch, King William III., found that
the conditions of the Treaty of Ryswick, concluded in
1697, were violated by the King of France, Louis
XIV., who, on the decease of Charles II. of Spain on
the 1st of November, 1700, pursued with unremitting
assiduity his ambitious project of ultimately uniting
the crowns of France and Spain, by procuring the
accession of his grandson, Philip, Duke of Anjou, to
the vacant throne; thus excluding the claims of the
House of Austria, and disregarding the existing treaties
between the principal nations of Europe. The
seizure of the Spanish Netherlands by the troops of
France,&mdash;the detention of the Dutch garrisons in
the barrier towns,&mdash;the declaration of Louis XIV.
in favour of the family of James II., and other acts of
hostility, justified the British Government in making
preparations for war.</p>

<p>King William had determined on active measures,
by sea and land, against the powers of France and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
Spain, and had accordingly directed augmentations to
be made in the navy and army. A division of the
army had been appointed, under the command of
Brigadier-General Ingoldsby, (twenty-third regiment,)
to embark for Flanders, and another portion of the
army was selected to embark for the coast of Spain,
under the orders of the Duke of Ormond.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1702</div>

<p>The death of King William III. took place on the
8th of March, 1702. His policy was adopted by his successor
Queen Anne, who entered into treaties of alliance
with the Emperor of Germany,&mdash;the States-General of
the United Provinces,&mdash;and other Princes and Potentates,
for preserving the liberty and balance of power
in Europe, and for defeating the ambitious views of
France.</p>

<p>The measures for increasing the efficiency of the
fleet had occasioned the suggestion of raising <em>Corps of
Marines</em>, capable of acting on land as well as at sea.
Several regiments of the regular army were appointed
to serve as Marines, and six additional regiments
were especially raised for that service.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>On the 14th of March, 1702, a Royal Warrant was
issued, authorising <span class="smcap">Colonel George Villiers</span> to
raise a <span class="smcap">Regiment of Marines</span>, which was to consist of
twelve companies, of two serjeants, three corporals,
two drummers, and fifty-nine private soldiers each,
with an additional serjeant to the grenadier company.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
The rendezvous of the regiment was appointed to be
at Taunton and Bridgewater.</p>

<p>For the raising of this regiment the following officers
received commissions, those of the field officers being
antedated to the 12th of February, 1702:&mdash;</p>

<p>The declaration of hostilities against France and
Spain was issued on the 4th of May, 1702: thus began,
“fruitful in great actions and important results,” <em>The
War of the Spanish Succession</em>.</p>

<p>Additional forces were sent to Flanders, and the
Earl of Marlborough was appointed to command the
confederate troops with the rank of Captain-General.</p>

<p>The expedition, which had been planned by King
William against Spain, was carried out by the Ministers
of Queen Anne. It was arranged, accordingly,
that a combined fleet of English and Dutch ships,
consisting of fifty sail of the line, besides frigates,
under Admiral Sir George Rooke, and a land force
amounting to nearly fourteen thousand men, under
the command of the Duke of Ormond, should proceed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
to the coast of Spain. The following corps were
employed on this service, namely:&mdash;</p>

<p>Colonel Villiers’s Corps of Marines, now the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>
regiment, soon after its formation was thus
called upon to supply five Companies for embarkation
for active service on board the fleet destined
against Spain: these Companies embarked in the
latter part of May from Plymouth, and proceeded to
join the fleet at Portsmouth, from whence the expedition
sailed to Cadiz in the month of July, 1702.</p>

<p>The armament appeared off Cadiz on the 12th of
August, and the Duke summoned the place; but his
terms being refused, he landed on the 15th at the Bay
of Bulls, between Rota and Fort St. Catherine, under
great disadvantages and a well conducted opposition:
he marched upon Rota, where the horses and stores
were disembarked, and in two days afterwards he advanced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
to the town of St. Mary. Rota was retaken
by a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup-de-main</i>, and the British garrison of 300
men was captured. The attempt on Cadiz failed; the
troops were re-embarked, and sailed from Cadiz on the
30th of September.</p>

<p>In alluding to this expedition, Bishop Burnet remarks,&mdash;“It
is certain our Court had false accounts of
the state the place was in, both with relation to the
garrison, and to the fortifications; the garrison was
much stronger, and the fortifications were in a better
state, than was represented.”</p>

<p>Conspicuous as the bravery of the troops had been in
the expedition against Cadiz, still the failure of the
attempt naturally caused painful feelings to arise
among the British soldiers, who were disappointed of
reaping the well-earned fame of a successful enterprise,
when victory appeared almost within their grasp. The
receipt of information of the arrival of a Spanish fleet
from the West Indies, under a French convoy, at the
harbour of Vigo, speedily dissipated these feelings, and
gave renewed hopes to the troops. The allied fleet
immediately bent its course thither, and arrived before
Vigo on the 22nd of October, 1702. The French admiral
Count de Chateaurenaud had placed his shipping and
the galleons within a narrow passage, the entrance
to which was defended by a castle on one side, and
by platforms mounted with cannon on both sides of
the inlet; a strong boom was thrown across the harbour.</p>

<p>To facilitate the attack on this formidable barrier,
the Duke of Ormond landed a portion of his army six
miles from Vigo on the 23rd of October, and took, by
assault, a battery of forty pieces of cannon, situated at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
the entrance of the bay. A British flag, hoisted on this
fort, was the signal for a general attack. The fleet in full
sail approached, broke the boom at the first shock, and
became closely engaged with the enemy’s ships, while
the British troops that had landed, stormed and captured
the batteries. After a vigorous defence, the French
and Spaniards, finding they could not escape, set fire to
some of their vessels, and cast their cargoes into the sea;
but the British exerted themselves nobly in extinguishing
the flames, and succeeded in saving six galleons
and seven ships of war. Two thousand of the enemy
are stated to have perished, and the Spaniards sustained
a loss in goods and treasure exceeding eight
million dollars, more than one-half of which fell to the
captors, whose loss in this victory was inconsiderable.
Queen Anne, attended by the Lords and Commons,
went in state to St. Paul’s Cathedral to return thanks
for this success, and each of the regiments of infantry
received 561<em>l.</em> 10<em>s.</em> prize-money.</p>

<p>Villiers’s Marines (<span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment) did not
land at Vigo, but served on board the fleet in this gallant
enterprise.</p>

<p>The troops under the Duke of Ormond subsequently
returned to England, and on their arrival in November,
1702, were stationed as follows, namely:&mdash;</p>

<p>On the 6th of January, 1703, seven companies of the
regiment were stationed at Plymouth, and on the 27th
of that month four companies were ordered for embarkation
on board of the ships Suffolk and Grafton,
which proceeded on service to the coast of Spain, to
join the fleet under Admiral Sir George Rooke, and continued
in that quarter, and in the Mediterranean, during
that year.</p>

<p>In December, 1703, Colonel Villiers, who was in
command of the Regiment on board of the fleet, was
drowned. He was succeeded in the Colonelcy of the
Regiment by Lieut.-Colonel Alexander Lutterell, on
the 6th of December of that year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1704</div>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment, being at this time a
Marine Corps, continued to serve on board the fleet in
the Mediterranean, and in February, 1704, proceeded,
under Admiral Sir George Rooke, to Lisbon, from
whence it proceeded to <em>Barcelona</em>, where the troops were
landed under the command of Major-General the
Prince of Hesse-Darmstadt, on the 19th of May; but
the force, being inadequate for the purpose intended,
was re-embarked on the day following.</p>

<p>The fleet next proceeded to attack the fortress of
<em>Gibraltar</em>, and the Prince of Hesse effected a landing
on the afternoon of the 21st of July, 1704, with eighteen
hundred <span class="smcap">British and Dutch Marines</span>: after a
bombardment of three days, the governor was forced
to capitulate, and the Prince of Hesse took possession
of the garrison on the evening of Sunday, the 24th of
July, 1704. The attack of the seamen and marines is
recorded in history to have been one of the boldest and
most difficult ever performed. The <em>fortress</em> of <em>Gibraltar</em>
was thus taken, and was besieged by the Spaniards<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
and French in October following, for seven months,
during which period it was successfully defended by
the navy and marines, and has since remained, as a
monument of British valour, in possession of the
Crown of Great Britain.</p>

<p>After selecting a sufficient force to garrison Gibraltar,
the Marine Corps were distributed in the several ships
of war which were then collected in the Tagus, in order
to co-operate with the land forces on the coast of Spain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1705</div>

<p>Towards the end of May, 1705, the British fleet having
about five thousand troops on board, with General
the Earl of Peterborough, proceeded to Lisbon; King
Charles embarked on board of the Ranelagh on the
23rd of July, and the Dutch fleet having joined in the
Tagus, proceeded from thence, and anchored before
Barcelona on the 22nd of August.</p>

<p>The Earl of Peterborough commenced operations
against <em>Barcelona</em> by an attack on the strong fortress
of <em>Montjuich</em>, which was taken by storm on the 17th
of September. In this attack the Prince of Hesse
Darmstadt was wounded by a musket-ball which occasioned
his death. The city of Barcelona was invested,
and after considerable efforts on the part of the besiegers
and the besieged, the garrison surrendered on
the 6th of October, 1705.</p>

<p>The capture of <em>Barcelona</em> obtained for the allied
forces the applause of the nations of Europe, and in
a great degree promoted the cause of King Charles
in his efforts to succeed to the Crown of Spain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1706</div>

<p>The decease of Colonel Lutterell having taken place,
he was succeeded by Lieut.-Colonel Josiah Churchill,
on the 1st of February, 1706.</p>

<p>The neglect of King Charles III. and his counsellors<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
to secure the advantages obtained by the conquests
before stated, and the persevering efforts made in
favour of King Philip V. by the French, and by those
persons in other countries who supported his cause,
occasioned great difficulties, as well as serious losses to
the allied forces.</p>

<p>A powerful French and Spanish force by land, aided
by a fleet, attempted the recapture of <em>Barcelona</em>, which
was besieged in the beginning of April, 1706; but
when the enemy had made preparations to attack the
place by storm, the English and Dutch fleet arrived
with reinforcements for the garrison;&mdash;the French relaxed
in their efforts, and the siege was raised on the
11th of May.</p>

<p>The city of Barcelona was thus relieved, and the
allied fleet, with the troops on board, proceeded to the
coast of Valencia; after capturing <em>Carthagena</em>, and
placing six hundred Marines for its defence, the expedition
proceeded to an attack upon <em>Alicant</em>, which,
after a gallant resistance and severe loss, surrendered
on the 25th of August, 1706.</p>

<p>The fleet then proceeded to <em>Iviça</em> and <em>Majorca</em>, which
surrendered to King Charles III., and detachments of
Marines were placed as garrisons in those islands.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1707</div>

<p>The defeat of the allied forces under the Earl of
Galway by the Duke of Berwick at <em>Almanza</em>, on the
25th of April, 1707, cast a gloom over the prospects of
King Charles in Spain; and in June following, measures
were adopted for co-operating with the Duke of Savoy
and the Prince Eugene, in an attack upon Toulon.
The fleet proceeded for the coast of Italy, and anchored
between Nice and Antibes, when a conference
took place with the commanders-in-chief of the sea and
land forces, and it was decided that a joint attack<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
should be made upon a portion of the enemy’s army
which was entrenched upon the river Var; the enemy
having evacuated his positions, they were immediately
occupied by several hundred British seamen and marines;
the passage was thus secured for the Duke of
Savoy to prosecute his designs, and ships were stationed
along different parts of the sea-coast: every aid was
afforded by the fleet; but the enemy, having been reinforced,
made a successful sally, and the allied forces
sustained considerable loss; the siege was consequently
raised on the 10th of August following.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1708</div>

<p>In consequence of King Charles having desired that
<em>Sardinia</em> should be reduced, with a view to a passage
being opened for his troops into Naples to attack Sicily,
and also to secure the means of supplying provisions
for his armies, it was decided that a body of <em>marines</em>
should be withdrawn from Catalonia to assist in this
enterprise. On the 12th of August, 1708, the armament
designed for this service arrived before <em>Cagliari</em>,
the capital of Sardinia, and after receiving a hesitating
reply to the summons to surrender, the bombardment
commenced on that evening, and continued until the
following morning, when, at the break of day, Major-General
Wills (Thirtieth regiment), at the head of the
Marines, with one Spanish regiment, landed, and the
place surrendered.</p>

<p>It was next decided that an attempt should be made
upon the island of <em>Minorca</em>. The fleet accordingly
set sail, and arrived before <em>Port Mahon</em> on the 28th of
August, 1708.</p>

<p>At this period the six <em>marine</em> regiments had been
much reduced in numbers by the arduous services on
which they had been employed from the commencement
of the war, so that it became necessary to draft<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
the men of <em>two</em> of these corps into the other four regiments,
in order to render this force effective for the
service for which it was now destined, and which, there
was reason to expect, would be difficult, and would
require the most energetic measures towards effecting
the conquest of the island. For this purpose all the
Marines fit for service, were drawn from the ships
about to return home, and were incorporated in the
four regiments which were employed in the reduction
of this island. The two regiments (Holl’s and Shannon’s)
returned to England in order to recruit their
numbers.</p>

<p>The fleet proceeded to commence operations, and the
first attack was against <em>Fort Fornelle</em>, which was cannonaded,
and surrendered after a contest of four hours;
a detachment proceeded to <em>Citadella</em>, the capital, which
surrendered; batteries, which had been erected, were
opened on the works defending the town of <em>Port Mahon</em>,
on the 17th of September, when, after a short but brisk
fire, a lodgment was effected under the walls of St.
<em>Philip’s Castle</em>, and on the following day the place surrendered.</p>

<p>The valuable and important <em>Island of Minorca</em> was
thus reduced to submission to the British Crown by
the gallantry of the Navy, and about two thousand four
hundred Marines; the island, which was ceded to
Great Britain at the Treaty of Utrecht, in 1713, continued
in the British possession until the year 1756,
when it was recaptured by a combined Spanish and
French force under the command of Marshal the Duke
de Richelieu.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1709</div>

<p>In the early part of the year 1709, an armament was
prepared for the purpose of attacking <em>Port Royal</em> in
the province of <em>Nova Scotia</em>, which was then in possession
of the French; the expedition was entrusted
to Colonel Nicholson of the Marines, and to Captain
Martin of the Navy. The squadron proceeded to
Boston, where it was reinforced by some ships, and by
provincial auxiliary troops: a council of war was held,
and arrangements were made for disembarking the
troops, which took place on the 24th of September.
The fortress surrendered on the 1st of October, and the
Marines took possession. The fortress was named
<em>Anna-polis Royal</em>, in honor of Queen Anne, in whose
reign the conquest was effected.</p>

<p>The affairs of Spain at this time had materially
changed, and the prospects of King Charles III. in
obtaining the monarchy had become very doubtful.
The town of <em>Alicant</em>, after sustaining a powerful siege
by the forces of Spain and France, was compelled to
surrender in April; the fleet under Admiral Sir
George Byng, and the troops on board under Lieut.-General<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
Stanhope, which were destined for its relief,
were prevented, by heavy gales and severe weather,
from communicating with the town, and affording
the desired assistance. The garrison consisted of
Colonel Sir Charles Hotham’s and Colonel Frederick
Sybourg’s regiments (afterwards disbanded), together
with a large body of Marines, who evinced the most
heroic perseverance in maintaining the place. On the
6th of April, 1709, the enemy sprung a mine, which
split the rock on which the <em>Castle of Alicant</em> was situated,
when Colonel Sybourg and several other officers were
swallowed up in the opening, which immediately closed.
Although they had been permitted to see the mine,
they refused to capitulate; the garrison afterwards
continued to defend the castle, until Lieut.-General
Stanhope, being unable to communicate with the town,
proposed terms of surrender, which being acceded
to, the gallant survivors of the siege were conveyed on
board the fleet, and were removed to Minorca, and
afterwards to Barcelona.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1710</div>

<p>In March, 1710, Admiral Sir John Norris, who had
arrived at Port Mahon as commander-in-chief of the
Naval forces, proceeded to Barcelona, in the month of
June, in order to concert with King Charles III. the
plan of future operations. It was determined that an
expedition should proceed against the <em>Isle of Cette</em> in
the province of Languedoc. His troops, including the
Marines, landed on the 13th of July, and after a feeble
resistance the fort surrendered: the regiment of Stanhope
and three hundred Marines advanced against
<em>Agde</em>, and the town surrendered. The <em>Isle of Cette</em> was
shortly afterwards recaptured by the French, but the
British troops had been previously re-embarked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1711</div>

<p>Colonel Churchill having received Her Majesty’s
permission to sell his commission, Lieut.-Colonel Sir
Harry Goring, Bart., was promoted to the Colonelcy
of the <span class="smcap">Thirty-first</span> Regiment by purchase, on the 1st
of March, 1711.</p>

<p>The decease of Joseph I., Emperor of Germany,
took place on the 17th of April, 1711, and King
Charles III. of Spain was elected Emperor of Germany,
by the title of Charles VI., on the 12th of October
of that year: this circumstance rendered unnecessary
any further attempts in the cause of King Charles
on the part of the British Government. His Majesty
embarked at Barcelona on board of the fleet, and proceeded
to assume the duties of the Imperial throne.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1712<br />1713</div>

<p>In the year 1712 negotiations were entered into between
Great Britain and France, and a Treaty of
Peace was concluded at Utrecht, on the 11th of April,
1713. By this treaty it was settled, that Great Britain
should retain possession of Gibraltar, Minorca, and
Nova Scotia, which had been conquered during the
war, and in acquiring which the <em>Marine</em> Corps had
greatly contributed.</p>

<p>From the period of the formation of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>
regiment, in the year 1702, as a <em>Corps of Marines</em>,
to the termination of the war by the Treaty of Utrecht
in 1713, the regiment was employed, by detachments,
on board the fleet, and was engaged on various services
at sea, as well as on land, according to the conditions on
which it was raised.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Among the reductions which were directed to take<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
place in the establishment of the army consequent on
the Peace of Utrecht, the <em>Marine Corps</em> were included in
the list of regiments to be discontinued.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1714</div>

<p>The decease of Queen Anne took place on the 1st of
August, 1714, and King George I., who was then at
Hanover, was immediately proclaimed as the Sovereign
of Great Britain and Ireland. The partisans of the
Pretender, James Francis Edward Stuart, son of the
late King, James II., renewed their exertions in his behalf;
and Jacobite principles had become so prevalent
in certain parts of the kingdom, that it was necessary
that the army, which had been considerably reduced
after the Peace of Utrecht, should be again augmented.</p>

<p>Six additional regiments of cavalry (from the ninth
to the fourteenth dragoons) were raised. The establishments
of the regiments of infantry were increased, and,
in consideration of the services of the Marine Corps
during the late war, Wills’s, now <em>thirtieth</em>,&mdash;Goring’s,
now <em>thirty-first</em>,&mdash;and Borr’s, now <em>thirty-second</em>, which
had been ordered to be disbanded, were retained on the
establishment, and were incorporated with the regiments
of infantry of the line, and authorised to take rank according
to the dates of their original formation in 1702.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1715</div>

<p>The adherents of the Stuart dynasty continued to be
numerous, particularly in Scotland, where active preparations
were made for the elevation of the “<em>Pretender</em>”
to the throne; and the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chevalier de St. George</i><a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> (so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
styled in France) repeated the attempt which he had
made in 1708, and effected a landing in Scotland
in December, 1715, where a rebellion had broken out
in September; the Earl of Mar had assembled his
vassals, erected the standard of the Pretender in the
Highlands, and had been joined by several clans, to the
number of ten thousand men. King George I. was
supported by his Parliament in adopting energetic
measures for opposing the designs of the Jacobites,
and for maintaining the Protestant Succession.</p>

<p>To oppose the rebellious forces, the Duke of Argyle
was appointed to the command of the army in Scotland.
After several movements and skirmishing, the rebel
army, commanded by the Earl of Mar, advanced, in the
early part of November, towards the Firth; and the
Duke of Argyle quitted the camp at Stirling, and proceeded
to the vicinity of <em>Dumblaine</em>. On the morning
of Sunday, the 13th of November, the hostile armies
confronted each other on <em>Sheriffmuir</em>. After half-an-hour’s
sharp fighting the left wing of the rebel army
gave way, and the King’s troops captured several
standards and colours; but while this portion of the
rebel army was being pursued, the rebels had defeated
the left wing of the royal army. Thus each commander
had a wing triumphant and a wing defeated: both
armies returned to their former ground, but the action
was not renewed. The rebels were, however, defeated
in their design of crossing the Firth, and they retired,
during the night, towards Perth. The royal army
returned to Stirling on the following day. The rebels
who had assembled in England under the Earl of
Derwentwater and Mr. Forster, were also compelled to
surrender at Preston, in Lancashire, to General Carpenter,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
on the same day as the battle of Sheriffmuir
was fought.</p>

<p>Towards the end of December the “<em>Pretender</em>”
arrived in Scotland, but his presence did not animate
the Scots sufficiently to induce them to renew the contest
in his behalf; they considered him unfit to be
the leader of a great military enterprise, although the
Chevalier is recorded in history to have greatly distinguished
himself in the battle of Malplaquet in 1709,
“when he charged twelve times with the household
troops of the King of France, and, in the last charge,
was wounded in the arm by a sword.” The Chevalier
had the credit of possessing plenty of animal courage,
when led by others, but no moral fortitude when left to
himself, and dependent upon his own resources.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1716</div>

<p>In the latter part of the year 1715 the royal army
had been joined by considerable reinforcements, and in
January, 1716, the Duke of Argyle advanced towards
Perth.</p>

<p>The Pretender and the Earl of Mar, being unable
to oppose effectual resistance, and seeing no prospect of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
establishing a footing in Scotland, withdrew from their
army privately, and escaped to France, after which the
Highlanders dispersed.</p>

<p>The rebellion in Scotland at this period thus terminated.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment proceeded to Ireland,
and continued to form a part of the force in that
portion of the United Kingdom until the year 1739.</p>

<p>On the retirement of Colonel Sir <em>Harry Goring</em>, on
the 8th of September, 1716, Lord John Kerr was
appointed to the Colonelcy of the regiment.</p>

<p>The remainder of the reign of King George I. did
not produce any events to give occasion for the active
services of the army, and the movements of regiments
from one station to another seldom took place.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1727</div>

<p>His Majesty’s decease occurred on the 11th of June,
1727, and his son, King George II., succeeded to the
throne.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1728</div>

<p>Major-General Lord John Kerr died on the 1st of
August, 1728, and on the 13th of that month, Colonel
the Honorable Charles Cathcart, from the Ninth foot,
was appointed to the Colonelcy of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>
regiment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1731</div>

<p>Colonel William Hargrave was promoted on the 1st of
January, 1731, from the Seventh Royal Fusiliers to
the Colonelcy of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment, in succession
to Colonel the Honorable Charles Cathcart, who
was removed to the Eighth dragoons.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1737</div>

<p>On the 27th of January, 1737, Colonel William Handasyd
was promoted from the Fifteenth foot to the
Colonelcy of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment, in succession
to Colonel William Hargrave, who was removed to the
Ninth foot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span></p>

<div class="sidenotex">1739</div>

<p>In the year 1739 the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment was
removed from Ireland to Great Britain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1740</div>

<p>In the two previous years the British merchants had
made great complaints against the Spanish depredations
in America, and on the 23rd of October, 1739, war was
proclaimed against Spain by Great Britain; and the
events which occurred in Germany in the following year
occasioned the contest that is designated the “War of
the Austrian Succession,” in which most of the European
powers became engaged, and which disturbed the long
interval of comparative peace that had succeeded the
Treaty of Utrecht.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>These events were occasioned by the decease of Charles
VI., Emperor of Germany, on the 20th of October,
1740. The Emperor was the last Prince of the House
of Austria, and he was succeeded in his hereditary dominions
by his eldest daughter, the Archduchess Maria
Theresa, who married, in 1736, the Duke Francis
Stephen, of Lorraine. The Duke, in the following year,
became Grand-Duke of Tuscany. Immediately on her
father’s decease, Maria Theresa was proclaimed Queen of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
Hungary and Bohemia, Princess of Transylvania, Archduchess
of Austria, and universal successor to all the
dominions of the House of Austria, pursuant to the
“<em>Pragmatic Sanction</em>;”<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and she declared her husband
co-regent in the government of her dominions.</p>

<p>Although the possessions of Austria were guaranteed
to the Archduchess Maria Theresa by the German Edict
known in history as the “<em>Pragmatic Sanction</em>,” to which
nearly all the powers of Europe had been parties, yet the
succession of the Archduchess to her father’s Austrian
hereditary territories was disputed by several claimants;
and among others by Charles Albert, Elector of Bavaria,
who was afterwards elected Emperor of Germany. The
King of Prussia also revived a dormant claim to Silesia,
which he invaded in November; the Prussian monarch
offered Maria Theresa sufficient money to resist all her
enemies, on condition of ceding Silesia to him, but the
proposition was indignantly rejected.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1741</div>

<p>The King of France supported the Elector of Bavaria,
while King George II. supported the Archduchess Maria
Theresa; and in April, 1741, the British Parliament
voted a subsidy of 300,000<em>l.</em> to the Queen of Hungary
and Bohemia. His Majesty also informed the Parliament,
that the Queen of Hungary had demanded the
twelve thousand troops he had stipulated to furnish; and
accordingly he had requested the King of Denmark and
the King of Sweden to hold in readiness their quotas of
six thousand men each, for the maintenance of which they
had received subsidies from England. King George II.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
was drawn into the war from the apprehension of losing
Hanover, but at this period His Majesty abstained from
being a principal in the contest, by agreeing with the
French sovereign, Louis XV., to give his vote, as Elector
of Hanover, to the Elector of Bavaria for the dignity of
Emperor of Germany, and thereby to preserve the
neutrality of his Hanoverian territories.</p>

<p>During 1741 and the previous year the regiment was
encamped at Windsor, and on Lexden Heath, near
Colchester, as part of the force ordered to be prepared
for the assistance of Maria Theresa, but no embarkation
for continental service took place during the year 1741.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1742</div>

<p>The Elector of Bavaria was chosen Emperor of Germany
at Frankfort on the Maine, and crowned, as Charles
VII., on the 11th of February, 1742: he was, however, a
most unhappy prince; his electoral dominions were overrun
by the Austrians, the French were driven out of
Bohemia, and the King of Prussia, under the mediation
of King George II., concluded a peace at Breslau with
the Queen of Hungary.</p>

<p>The King of England resolving to take a more active
part in the war, an army of sixteen thousand men, under
Field-Marshal the Earl of Stair, was ordered to be embarked
for the Netherlands in the summer of 1742, in
order to support the Queen of Hungary.</p>

<p>On the 17th of May the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment
embarked at Deptford for Flanders, having been previously
reviewed on Kew-green by King George II. and
the Duke of Cumberland, with the other regiments
destined for the above service.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> No action took place<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
during the year, the troops being suddenly marched into
winter-quarters, after every preparation had been made
for active operations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1743</div>

<p>In the commencement of the year 1743 the British
and Hanoverian troops were assembled in the Low
Countries, commanded by Field-Marshal the Earl of
Stair, as <em>allies</em> to the Austrians, under the command of
Marshal Neuperg and the Duke d’Aremberg, and advanced
towards Germany, in order to secure the navigation
of the Upper Maine. The French Marshal,
Noailles, had anticipated the British general, and was
already on the opposite shore of this river, and in possession
of its principal posts when the Allies arrived at
Aschaffenberg. Here the Allied army remained until
June, on the 19th of which month King George II.,
attended by the Duke of Cumberland, arrived at the camp.</p>

<p>The two armies were encamped on the plains near the
banks of the Maine, opposite to, and in sight of, each
other; with a ridge of hills, covered with woods on the
north of each, the Allies being on the north and the
French on the south side of the river. The Confederate
army amounted to nearly forty thousand men, in high
spirits, though nearly destitute of provisions. A retrograde
movement being resolved on for the purpose of
obtaining supplies, as well as to effect a junction with a
corps of twelve thousand Hessians and Hanoverians, in
some danger of being cut off at Hanau, His Majesty,
on the evening of the 26th of June, gave orders that
the army should hold itself in readiness to march on
the following morning; accordingly the Confederate
army marched towards <em>Dettingen</em> before daylight on
the morning of the 27th of June. The army was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
weakened for want of provisions, the soldiers having
been on half-rations for some time, and the horses were
without forage.</p>

<p>Marshal Noailles immediately ordered a large force of
cavalry and infantry, composed of the household troops
and of the Royal Guards, to the village of <em>Dettingen</em>, by
which the British had to pass. The <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment,
under the command of Lieut.-Colonel Montague,
was in advance towards Dettingen, when the French
made the above movement, and gave the first intelligence
of it to His Majesty.</p>

<p>Aschaffenberg was occupied by the French the moment
it was evacuated by the Allies. The Confederate
army had to march through a narrow way between a
mountain and the Maine, the cannon on the opposite side
of the river commanding its flank. Dettingen, in front,
was occupied in force by the French, and also Aschaffenberg
in the rear. In this situation the destruction of the
Allies seemed inevitable; but Marshal Noailles having
repassed the river, the Duke de Grammont, who succeeded
to the command, advanced to the attack through
the defile, thus relinquishing all the advantages of his
position. The British troops, animated by the presence
of their Sovereign, on the 27th of June, received the impetuous
attack of the French with such steadiness and
intrepidity, that the latter were forced to retire, and recross
the Maine with the greatest precipitation and the
loss of five thousand men.</p>

<p>The Twentieth and <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiments were in
reserve in a wood on the British right, and towards the
afternoon they were led into action by his Majesty in
person, who evinced the same martial qualities for which
he was distinguished at the battle of Oudenarde, on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
11th of July, 1708, when Hereditary Prince of Brunswick
Lunenburg.</p>

<p>The regiment sustained but trifling loss at the battle of
Dettingen, in consequence of its having been in reserve
during the early part of the action.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>Although the victory was highly honorable to those
by whom it was gained, yet it was productive of no decisive
results.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> The allied army continued its march to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
Hanau; it subsequently crossed the Rhine, and was employed
in West Germany, but returned to Flanders for
winter-quarters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1744</div>

<p>On the 20th of March, 1744, France declared war
against England, and on the 29th of that month a counter-declaration
was made by Great Britain, in which the
French monarch was accused of violating the “<em>Pragmatic
Sanction</em>,” and of assisting the son of the Pretender
in his designs on the British throne.</p>

<p>The regiment served the campaign of 1744 with the
army commanded by Field-Marshal Wade; it was encamped
some time on the banks of the Scheldt, and afterwards
penetrated the French territory to the vicinity of
Lisle, but no general engagement occurred.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1745</div>

<p>In January, 1745, the Emperor Charles VII. died at
Munich, and Francis, Grand-Duke of Tuscany, consort
of Maria Theresa, became a candidate for the Imperial
crown; this event changed the aspect of affairs in Germany,
and led to the re-establishment of the House of
Austria in the Imperial dignity.</p>

<p>Colonel Lord Henry Beauclerk was appointed, on the
22nd of April, 1745, from the forty-eighth to the
Colonelcy of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment, in succession to
Colonel W. Handasyd, deceased.</p>

<p>His Royal Highness the Duke of Cumberland was
appointed to the command of the Confederate army,
and on the French investing Tournay, which towards the
end of April was besieged by an immense force, under
Marshal Count de Saxe, His Royal Highness determined
to raise the siege, which resulted in the battle of
<em>Fontenoy</em>.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 11th of May, the formidable
position at <em>Fontenoy</em>, occupied by the superior numbers of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
the enemy, was attacked, when the British infantry evinced
that heroism for which that <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">arme</i> of the service has ever
been conspicuous, and forced the enemy’s position; but
being exposed to a destructive cross-fire, in consequence
of the Dutch having failed in their attack on the village
of Fontenoy, and Brigadier-General Ingoldsby not
having captured a battery in the wood of Barry, the
British regiments, which had forced the French position,
were ordered to retire. The attack was repeated, with the
same results: British valour was conspicuous, but the
failure of the Dutch rendered a retreat necessary, and
the Allied army withdrew to Aeth.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>In the London Gazette it was stated that,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Highland regiment (42nd), the regiment late
Handasyd’s (<span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>), Duroure’s (12th), and
many others also distinguished themselves. The honor
gained by the Infantry was in a great measure owing to
the conduct and bravery of Lieut.-General Ligonier.”</p>
</div>

<p>It was the practice at this period in all the armies of Europe
to form battalions of <em>Grenadiers</em> of the different regiments
composing the force in the field; it was their
privilege to lead upon all arduous occasions, when they
were ever conspicuous, and suffered the most. The
<em>grenadier</em> company of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment
brought only <em>eleven</em> men out of the field of Fontenoy, of
the seventy-five that it took into action, and its captain
and subalterns were killed.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment had Lieut.-Colonel Montague,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
Captains Baird and Pollock, Lieutenant Dalway,
four serjeants, and one hundred and twenty-five rank and
file <em>killed</em>; Lieutenants Stafford and Porter, Ensigns
Worsley, Bromley, and Freeman, six serjeants, and one
hundred and thirty rank and file, <em>wounded</em>.</p>

<p>Tournay made a gallant defence until the 21st of June,
when it surrendered to Marshal Saxe.</p>

<p>After the battle of Fontenoy the Allied army encamped
at Lessines and Grammont, when a demonstration being
made by the French to attack the Confederates, it was
concentrated at the latter place, in order to receive them.
After exchanging a few cannon-shots, the enemy withdrew,
showing a disposition to surround the Allies, which
determined the Duke of Cumberland to fall back on
Brussels.</p>

<p>The Confederate generals suspected that the French
would make an attempt upon Ghent, and therefore despatched
Lieut.-General Baron de Molck to Ghent to
reinforce the garrison of that fortress. The troops appointed
for this service were Sir Robert Rich’s (fourth)
dragoons, three squadrons of Slipperbach’s dragoons, and
two squadrons of the regiments of Ligne and Styrum,
and seven hundred hussars; with a battalion of the Royal
regiment of foot, and Bligh’s and <span class="smcap">Handasyd’s</span> regiments
(Twentieth and <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> foot); in all about four
thousand men.</p>

<p>The Baron de Molck led his column along the cause-way
of Alost, until he reached the Priory of <em>Melle</em> (<em>Pas
du Mésle</em>), when it was suddenly assailed by a volley from
two batteries near the priory, and the next moment from
ten to fifteen thousand French sprang from their concealment
among the trees and surrounded the detachment.
The Baron de Molck attacked them with such resolution,
that he forced a passage, and arrived safely in Ghent with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
the fourth dragoons, the Royals, and the hussars. Brigadier
Bligh, finding it impossible to follow the Lieut.-General,
drew off to the right with his own regiment (the
20th), the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>, and the Austrian and Dutch dragoons,
forced a passage through the enemy, gained an
adjacent wood, and retired thence to Dendermond, twelve
miles east of Ghent. The loss of the Allies amounted to
about six hundred men. This action, which was fought
on the 9th of July, is called by the French the combat of
<em>La Mésle</em>. In the account of this affair published at the
time, it was stated that “our troops behaved with incredible
bravery, and have acquired immortal honor.” Ghent
was shortly afterwards taken by the French.</p>

<p>The allied army remained entrenched between Antwerp
and Brussels until the French Marshal had reduced the
chief fortified places in Austrian Flanders.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>On the 2nd of September the Grand-Duke of Tuscany
was elected Emperor of Germany, by the title of Francis I.
At this period the rebellion in Scotland began to assume
a formidable aspect. Prince Charles Edward, eldest son
of the Pretender, who had arrived in the Highlands
towards the end of July, had been joined by several clans,
and on the 16th of September proclaimed his father King
of Great Britain, at Edinburgh. The success gained
over the Royal army, under Lieutenant-General Sir John
Cope, at <em>Preston-Pans</em>, on the 21st of September, caused
numerous adherents to flock to the Prince’s standard.</p>

<p>Several regiments were in consequence recalled from
the Continent, and the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>, with other corps,
arrived in the river Thames on the 25th of October.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment, which had been much
reduced by its casualties during the campaigns in Flanders,
did not proceed to Scotland, but remained in the vicinity
of London. The young Pretender marched as far as
Derby, from whence he commenced his retreat to the north
on the 6th of December, as he found but few partisans in
England to join him in his expedition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1746</div>

<p>On the 16th of April, 1746, a decisive blow was given
to the hopes of the Pretender by the defeat of the rebels
at <em>Culloden</em>. Prince Charles, after enduring many hardships,
escaped to France.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1747</div>

<p>Several regiments were now ordered to return to Flanders,
but the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> remained in Great Britain.
On the 2nd of July, 1747, the Duke of Cumberland
engaged the French at <em>Laffeld</em>, or <em>Val</em>, where the Allies
suffered severely from the misconduct of the Dutch troops.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1748</div>

<p>In the summer of 1748 the Allies again took the field,
but hostilities were at length terminated by the treaty of
Aix-la-Chapelle, which was signed on the 7th of October,
1748. By it all the great treaties, from that of Westphalia
in 1648, which first recognised the principle of a
balance of power in Europe, to that of Vienna in 1738
were renewed and confirmed. Prussia retained Silesia,
and the Empress-Queen, Maria Theresa, was guaranteed
in the possession of her hereditary dominions, according to
the Pragmatic Sanction. France surrendered her conquests
in Flanders, and England those in the East and
West Indies; all therefore Great Britain gained by the
war was the glory of having supported the German sovereignty
of Maria Theresa, and of having adhered to
former treaties.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1749</div>

<p>Colonel Henry Holmes was appointed by King
George II. to the Colonelcy of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
on the 8th of May, 1749, in succession to Colonel
Lord Henry Beauclerk, who retired from the service.</p>

<p>In the year 1749 the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment was
embarked for Minorca, where it remained for the three
following years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1751</div>

<p>In the Royal Warrant, dated the 1st of July, 1751, for
ensuring uniformity in the clothing, standards, and colours
of the army, and regulating the number and rank of
regiments, the facings of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment were
directed to be <em>Buff</em>. The first, or King’s colour, was the
Great Union; the second, or Regimental colour, was of
<em>Buff</em> silk, with the Union in the upper canton; in the
centre of the colour the number of the rank of the regiment,
in gold Roman characters, within a wreath of roses
and thistles on the same stalk.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1752</div>

<p>In 1752 the regiment returned to England from
Minorca.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1753<br />1754</div>

<p>During the years 1753 and 1754 the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>
regiment was stationed in England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1755</div>

<p>In the year 1755 the regiment proceeded to Scotland,
in which country it remained for seven years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1756</div>

<p>While the regiment was stationed in North Britain,
the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle was interrupted by the
aggressions of the French on the British territory in
North America, and early in 1756 the King of France
prepared a powerful armament for the capture of the
island of Minorca. In consequence of this attack on
Minorca, hostilities became inevitable on the part of
Great Britain, and on the 18th of May war was declared
against France.</p>

<p>The garrison of Minorca, consisting of the 4th, 23rd,
24th, and 34th regiments, after making a noble and
vigorous defence, which called forth the unqualified admiration<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
of their opponents, was forced to surrender on
the 29th of June.</p>

<p>At this period the army and navy were increased, and
among other augmentations, fifteen of the regiments of
infantry were authorised to raise second battalions from
the 25th of August, 1756.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1758</div>

<p>In 1758 these additional battalions were formed into
distinct corps, and numbered from the sixty-first to the
seventy-fifth regiment. By this arrangement, the second
battalion of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment was constituted
the present <em>Seventieth</em> regiment.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1759</div>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment, having been selected to
remain in the United Kingdom, was precluded from
taking a part in <em>The Seven Years’ War</em>, the most memorable
occurrences of which were, the battle of <em>Plassey</em>, gained
in India by Colonel Clive, on the 23rd of June, 1757,
which laid the foundation of the British dominion in
India; in Germany, the battle of <em>Minden</em>, which was
fought on the 1st of August, 1759; in North America,
the capture of <em>Cape Breton</em>, in July, 1758; and the capture
of <em>Quebec</em>, in September, 1759, which cost the life
of the gallant <em>General Wolfe</em>, but which led to the conquest
of <em>Canada</em> in the following year, when <em>Montreal</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
with the whole of that country, surrendered to General
Amherst, in September, 1760.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1760</div>

<p>In Germany several hard-fought but indecisive actions
occurred: the battle of Warbourg, on the 31st of July,
1760; the action near the Convent of Campen, on the
16th of October following; and the battle of Kirch
Denkern, or Fellinghausen, on the 15th and 16th of July,
1761. In the following year actions were fought at
Wilhelmstahl and at Amonebourg; the former on the
24th of June, and the latter on the 21st of September.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1762</div>

<p>On the 4th of January, 1762, war was declared against
Spain; and Martinique, Grenada, St. Vincent, and other
West India islands surrendered to English valour. The
important city of Havannah, in Cuba, also capitulated to
the British arms.</p>

<p>These successes were followed by a Treaty of Peace, the
preliminary articles of which were signed at Fontainebleau,
by the Duke of Bedford, on the 3rd of November, 1762.</p>

<p>In June, 1762, the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment proceeded
from Scotland to England, where it was stationed during
the two following years.</p>

<p>On the 20th of August, 1762, Colonel James Adolphus
Oughton, from the fifty-fifth regiment, was appointed by
His Majesty King George III. to the Colonelcy of the
<span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment, in succession to Lieutenant-General
Henry Holmes, deceased.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1763</div>

<p>The treaty of Fontainebleau was concluded at Paris on
the 10th of February, the ratifications were exchanged on
the 10th of March, and peace was proclaimed in London
on the 22nd of that month.</p>

<p>By this treaty, the whole of Canada, part of Louisiana,
together with Cape Breton, and the other islands in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
Gulf of St. Lawrence, were ceded to Great Britain. In
the West Indies, the islands of Tobago, Dominica, St.
Vincent, and Grenada were retained by Great Britain;
but Martinique, Guadaloupe, Marigalante, and St. Lucia
were restored to France. In the East Indies, the French
obtained the restitution of their settlements, but agreed
not to erect any fortifications in Bengal. Minorca was
restored to England in exchange for Belle-Isle, which had
been captured by the British in 1761, and it was stipulated
that the fortifications of Dunkirk should be demolished.
Spain ceded East and West Florida to Great Britain, in
return for the restitution of the Havannah, Manilla, and
all the places which Spain had lost since the commencement
of the war.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1765</div>

<p>In this year the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment was embarked
for Pensacola, the capital of West Florida, which country
had been ceded to Great Britain by Spain at the peace of
Fontainebleau; on the passage out, the transport having
the regiment on board put into Blue-field Bay, Jamaica,
at the time the yellow fever was raging with great violence
in that island; the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> took the infection, and
unfortunately carried it to Pensacola, where the soldiers
continued to suffer most severely; so great was the mortality,
and so rapid the disease in its course, that the regiment
could not supply men to carry their comrades to
the grave. The men who attended the funerals of their
brother soldiers in the morning, while the regiment was
strong enough to preserve some ceremony, were, in
many instances, consigned to the tomb in the evening.
It appears by the newspapers of the period, in which
allusion is made to the mortality, that at one period of its
illness the regiment could muster only a corporal and six
men for duty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1772</div>

<p>The regiment remained in the Floridas, garrisoning
alternately St. Augustine and Pensacola, the capitals of
East and West Florida, until the autumn of 1772, when
it was embarked for <em>St. Vincent</em>, to take part in reducing
to submission the refractory Caribs in that island.</p>

<p>The island of St. Vincent was captured from the
French, in 1762, and was ceded to Great Britain at the
peace concluded in the following year; it contained two
tribes of natives, called the <em>red</em> and <em>black</em> Caribs, the former
being the aborigines, and the latter having sprung from a
cargo of African slaves, who escaped from a vessel which
was wrecked on the island. The Caribs were devoted to
the French interest; they were dangerous and troublesome
neighbours to the English planters, and it was
found necessary to restrain their conduct, and enforce
obedience to a few salutary regulations. They were,
however, of a resolute spirit, possessed many thickly
wooded fastnesses, and resisted all attempts to restrain
their roving propensities and mode of life with such determination,
that it became necessary to augment the military
force on the island. Although they were contemptible
opponents in skill, yet the nature of the climate,
and the natural difficulties of the country, being thickly
wooded where they inhabited, rendered the service extremely
tedious and arduous.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1773</div>

<p>On the 14th of January, 1773, the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment
fell into an ambuscade, and sustained some loss;
the commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Ralph
Walsh, was among the killed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1774</div>

<p>After the troops had been in the woods for some
months, they at length succeeded, in February, 1774,
in bringing the Caribs to terms, who agreed to
acknowledge the sovereignty of Great Britain, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
were permitted to preserve their own laws and customs.</p>

<p>Thus terminated the Carib war. The <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>
regiment returned to England, and was subsequently
stationed in North Britain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1775</div>

<p>At this period the unfortunate misunderstanding
between Great Britain and her American colonies, on
the subject of taxation, produced open hostilities. On
the 19th of April the first collision occurred at <em>Lexington</em>,
and on the 17th of June following the battle of
<em>Bunker’s Hill</em> was fought. During the winter <em>Quebec</em>
was besieged by an American Army: this fortress was
gallantly defended by the troops under Lieut.-General
Guy Carleton, and reinforcements were ordered to
proceed from England to Canada.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1776</div>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment proceeded from Glasgow
to Cork, whence it embarked for Canada in April, as
part of the army under Major-General Burgoyne.
The transports arrived at Quebec on the 28th of May,
shortly after the defeat of the Americans by a sortie
of the garrison. Lieut.-General Carleton had pursued
the enemy up the river St. Lawrence, and Major-General
Burgoyne’s force remained only one night at
anchor below Quebec, where orders had been left for
him to follow. He joined at <em>Trois Rivières</em>; part of
the army disembarked and immediately occupied the
villages adjacent to their post on the road to Montreal.
On the 8th of June the Americans attempted to surprise
the post of Trois Rivières, having passed the
river from Sorel with two thousand men.</p>

<p>Brigadier-General Fraser, who commanded at the
post of <em>Trois Rivières</em>, gave the foe a ready reception,
with such men as he could collect, and, being soon supported<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
from the cantonments and the transports, put
the Americans to the rout. The troops pursued the
fugitives along the shore, while the shipping sailed up
the river and intercepted their flight. Major-General
Thompson, the American General, with many officers,
and two hundred men, were taken prisoners.</p>

<p>On the 14th of June the flotillas and the force on
shore reached Sorel, which the colonists had evacuated
a few hours before; Major-General Burgoyne continued
the pursuit as far as St. John’s, where the
troops from the transports under Major-General
Phillips joined him, and soon afterwards an additional
reinforcement under Brigadier-General Fraser.</p>

<p>All hope of accommodation now failed; on the 4th of
July the American Congress issued their Declaration of
Independence, and abjured their allegiance to the
Crown of Great Britain. By this Declaration the
name of <em>colonies</em> was abolished, and the <em>thirteen</em> provinces,
namely, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island,
Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,
Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South
Carolina, and Georgia, were constituted the <em>United
States</em> of America.</p>

<p>The whole of Major-General Burgoyne’s army was
assembled by the end of July at St. John’s, where it
remained encamped during the naval operations on
Lake Champlain. After the defeat of the American
fleet, on the 11th of October, the weather becoming too
severe for further operations in the field, the troops returned
to Canada. The posts occupied by the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>
regiment during the winter were Sorel, St.
Charles, St. Denis, St. Anthony, and St. Ours.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1777</div>

<p>Major-General Burgoyne, who had proceeded to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
England to submit to the Government a plan for the
ensuing campaign, arrived in Canada in May, 1777,
empowered to carry it out. An army, composed of
British, Dutch, and Colonial Corps, with the <em>flank</em>
companies of the regiments left to garrison Quebec
(among which was the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment),
amounting to nearly eight thousand men, was equipped
and in the field by the 1st of July.</p>

<p>The flank companies of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>, commanded
by Captains Cotton and Simpson, formed, with the
other flank companies and the twenty-fourth regiment,
the advance of the army under Brigadier-General
Fraser. <em>Ticonderago</em> was first attacked, and
the Provincials were forced to evacuate that post.</p>

<p>Major-General Burgoyne’s plan was to penetrate
the United States from Lake Champlain to the river
Hudson, and advance upon Albany, with the view of
reducing that country to submission. While Major-General
Burgoyne moved towards the lake by <em>Skenesborough</em>,
a short distance inland from South Bay, where
an action occurred on the 6th of July, Brigadier-General
Fraser, with the advance, followed the Provincial
troops towards <em>Castleton</em>, and on the following day
commenced an action by detaching his light companies
to occupy a height commanding their flank. The
American General observing this movement detached
a force to prevent the British obtaining possession of
this post. A sharp action ensued, and the Americans
retreated with much loss to Huberton, where, meeting
with a reinforcement, they made a stand in good order.
Brigadier-General Fraser attacked them with great
vigour, but not having half their number, made no
impression upon them, until Major-General Reidesel,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
commanding the Dutch, arrived, when their flank being
turned, the Americans retreated, leaving two hundred
dead on the field, among whom was Colonel Francis,
their commander.</p>

<p>The flank companies were hotly engaged in this
affair. Brigadier-General Fraser had but 850 men in
the beginning of the day, while the enemy amounted
to 2000.</p>

<p>When Major-General Burgoyne joined, he pursued
the Americans to Fort Anne and Fort Edward, notwithstanding
the natural difficulties of the road, which
the enemy increased by every possible means that
could be devised. The Americans retreated from Fort
Edward to Saratoga, and abandoning Fort George,
left the navigation of Lake George open to Major-General
Burgoyne.</p>

<p>General Arnold was now appointed to command the
Americans in the British front, and, forming at Saratoga,
fell back to <em>Stillwater</em>. Major-General Burgoyne
remained at Fort Edward in great want of provisions
and of means to advance; a detachment sent to procure
supplies was completely cut off at Bennington, while
Lieut.-Colonel St. Leger was compelled to raise the
siege of Fort Stanwix, leaving behind his equipage
and baggage.</p>

<p>The Americans, greatly elated by these circumstances,
had assembled a large body under Major-General
Gates at <em>Stillwater</em>. Small parties having
been detached to Lieut.-General Burgoyne’s<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> rear,
were in some measure successful, and his communication
being thus threatened, notwithstanding his difficulties,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
arising from want of resources, he resolved to
advance, and at all hazards to attempt a junction with
the troops under Lieut.-General Sir Henry Clinton,
taking with him thirty days’ provisions. Lieut.-General
Burgoyne crossed the river Hudson on the 13th and
14th of September by a bridge of rafts, which had once
been swept away, and on the 18th arrived at <em>Stillwater</em>,
before the enemy’s position, which he attacked at two
o’clock in the afternoon of the 19th of September, when
a severe and indecisive action ensued. Both parties
held their respective positions, and entrenched themselves
within them. The British General, confined
between two rivers by a stronger force than his own,
continued within his lines and redoubts until the 7th
of October, and when nearly destitute of provisions,
determined to make another effort to extricate his
troops; 1500 British, with twelve pieces of artillery,
commanded by Lieut.-General Burgoyne in person,
moved in advance towards the American position, and
formed his right wing, while a body of light companies
and Indians were placed under cover to act upon the
enemy’s rear when he should be sufficiently advanced.
General Gates, observing this separation of wings, instantly
attacked the left wing with a view to cut off
all chance of a junction; the British grenadiers were
in this wing, and behaved with great gallantry.
General Arnold attacked the British right, and Brigadier-General
Fraser threw the light companies into a
second line, in rear of the right wing, to cover its
retreat upon the left. While this movement was
taking place, the left of the right wing doubled to the
rear. Brigadier-General Fraser led the light infantry
to its support, but was mortally wounded; not, however,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
before his brave troops gave the right wing time
to recover, and secured Lieut.-General Burgoyne’s
retreat to his camp. The Americans pushed on, and
obtained an entrance into the British lines: night put
an end to the action.</p>

<p>During the night Lieut.-General Burgoyne removed
his position to higher ground in his rear. General
Gates distributed his corps to surround the British,
and Lieut.-General Burgoyne once more tried a new
position, retiring on <em>Saratoga</em>, and abandoning his
baggage and provisions, as well as his hospital with
300 sick. He reached Saratoga safely, the Americans
having been delayed in their pursuit by bad weather:
a detachment, sent to observe the British, succeeded
in reaching the place, but withdrew on the appearance
of Lieut.-General Burgoyne’s force. Sending a detachment
with workmen to examine and repair the roads,
Lieut.-General Burgoyne resolved to continue his
retreat to Fort George. The detachment, which was
of regular troops, had scarcely marched, when the
Americans appeared in force; it was instantly recalled,
and the hope of rendering the roads passable for artillery
was abandoned. The British patrols reported
that every avenue of escape was in possession of the
enemy; the men were worn down with fatigue and
hunger, having been for some time on a reduced allowance,
and but three days’ provisions remained. Under
these circumstances Lieut.-General Burgoyne was constrained
to treat with Major-General Gates, and obtaining
honorable terms, capitulated on the 17th of
October. The troops, of which the <em>grenadier</em> and <em>light
companies</em> of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> formed part, laid down
their arms on condition of being sent to England; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
they engaged not to serve again in North America
during the war.</p>

<p>The American government violated the conditions
of the convention, and detained the troops until the
year 1781.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1778<br />1779</div>

<p>In 1778 the French monarch sent a numerous fleet
under the Count D’Estaing, having on board a large
body of troops, to the assistance of the Americans; in
1779 the court of Spain commenced hostilities against
Great Britain, and this example was followed by the
Dutch.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1780</div>

<p>Major-General Thomas Clarke, from the Coldstream
Guards, was appointed, on the 3rd of May, 1780, to
the Colonelcy of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment, in succession
to Lieut.-General Sir James Adolphus Oughton,
K.B., deceased.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1781</div>

<p>The <em>battalion</em> companies of the regiment had remained
in Canada, where they eventually were joined
by the <em>flank</em> companies. On the 12th of March, 1781,
the <em>light company</em> was detached to Lake Champlain,
with a view of reconnoitring the neighbourhood, and
effecting the destruction of the military stores left at
Ticonderago by Lieut.-General Burgoyne. The object
was partly accomplished, and Captain Andrew Ross,
who commanded the company, gained great credit for
the skill and conduct he displayed in this difficult
enterprise. The party consisted, in addition to the
<em>light company</em> of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>, of men selected
from the different Provincial corps, with a few Indians.
It was in the spring of the year, when the ice was
breaking up, and the operations were attended with
difficulties and great privations. The men suffered so
severely from fatigue, that the Provincials and Indians<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
dropped off by degrees, and the party was reduced, on
its return, to the <em>light company</em> only.</p>

<p>During July the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment was encamped
on the Plain of Abraham, memorable as the
scene of the British victory over the French under the
Marquis de Montcalm, on the 13th September, 1759,
by which Quebec was gained to England, and in which
battle the celebrated Major-General Wolfe lost his life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1782</div>

<p>In October, 1781, the British army under Lieut.-General
the Earl Cornwallis, after a gallant defence
against the combined French and American forces,
was compelled to surrender to General Washington at
York-Town. The enormous expense of carrying on
the war with America, so distant from the seat of
preparation and power, with the other evils attending
this memorable and ever-to-be regretted contest, were
so apparent, that the desire for peace became general,
and King George III. at length conceded the Independence
of the United States. The Preliminary
Articles of Peace were signed at Paris on the 30th of
November, 1782, by the Commissioners of the King of
Great Britain and by those of the American Congress,
and the Treaty was concluded in the ensuing February.</p>

<p>While the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> was stationed in Canada,
a letter, dated the 31st of August, 1782, conveyed to
the regiment His Majesty’s pleasure that <em>County-titles</em>
should be given to the regiments of infantry, and the
<span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> was directed to assume the name of the
<span class="smcap">Huntingdonshire</span> regiment, in order that a connexion
between the corps and that county should be cultivated,
which might be useful in furthering the success of the
recruiting service.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1783</div>

<p>The preliminaries of the treaties between England,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
France, and Spain, were signed at Versailles on the
20th of January, 1783. St. Lucia was restored to
France, also the settlements on the river Senegal, and
the city of Pondicherry in the East Indies. France
relinquished all her West India conquests, with the
exception of Tobago; Spain retained Minorca (which
she had captured in the previous year) and West
Florida; East Florida was ceded in exchange for the
restitution of the Bahamas to Great Britain.</p>

<p>On the 2nd of September, 1783, were signed the
Preliminary Articles of Peace with Holland, the peace
with that country having been postponed in consequence
of the Dutch claiming an indemnification for the
expenses of the war, and the restoration of Trincomalee,
in Ceylon, which had been captured from the Dutch by
the English, in January, 1782, and retaken by the
French in August following. The place was, however,
restored to Holland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1787</div>

<p>After eleven years’ service in North America, the
<span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment embarked, on the 4th of October,
1787, at Quebec, and on the 7th of November
landed at Portsmouth.</p>

<p>During the two following years the regiment remained
in Great Britain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1789</div>

<p>In the year 1789 was effected the French Revolution;
the Bastile was stormed by the Parisians on the 14th of
July, and the Governor put to death. The National
Assembly passed several decrees abolishing all the relies
of the feudal system. On the 20th of August a declaration
of rights was agreed on to serve as the basis of the
French constitution. A national force was embodied,
and no vestige of the old government remained, except
a King without power, and a Court without splendour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span></p>

<p>In the summer of 1789 two British vessels were
seized by the commander of a Spanish frigate at
Nootka Sound, on the western coast of North America,
where a settlement had recently been established for
carrying on the fur-trade with the natives. The settlement
was taken possession of by Spain, and the British
crews were made prisoners. The Government, on
receiving this intelligence, called upon the Court of
Madrid to make satisfaction for these injuries, and
great preparations were made for war by both countries.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1790</div>

<p>Accordingly in July, 1790, the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment
embarked at Spithead on board the fleet to
perform its <em>original</em> service of <span class="smcap">Marines</span>, in the event of
a war with Spain, which appeared probable. The
negotiations were protracted to a considerable length of
time, but on the 28th of October a convention was
entered into, by which Spain agreed to make reparation
for the injuries sustained, and to restore Nootka.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1791</div>

<p>In July, 1791, the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment was sent
hastily to Birmingham, to aid in the suppression of
very serious disturbances, which broke out there in
consequence of the celebration of the anniversary of the
French Revolution, on the 14th of July, 1791, by a
party of the “Friends of Freedom,” at a tavern. The
populace destroyed the house and chapel of Dr. Priestley,
the eminent philosopher, and burned many of the
dwellings of those suspected to be friendly to the
French cause. The troops employed were praised for
their regularity and forbearance on this occasion.</p>

<p>When order had been restored in Birmingham, an
outbreak among the miners at Whitehaven called for
the assistance of the military, and the regiment was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
again employed in the delicate as well as unpleasant
duty of aiding the civil power in the suppression of
riot.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1792</div>

<p>Major-General James Stuart was appointed from the
half-pay of the Ninetieth regiment to the Colonelcy
of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment on the 8th of February,
1792, in succession to Lieutenant-General Thomas
Clarke, removed to the Thirtieth regiment.</p>

<p>On the 17th of April, 1792, the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment
embarked at Port Patrick for Ireland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1793</div>

<p>Colonel Henry Lord Mulgrave, from the Grenadier
Guards, was appointed Colonel of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>
regiment on the 8th of February, 1793, in succession
to Major-General James Stuart, deceased. His Lordship
subsequently assumed the command of the
regiment at Waterford, as its Colonel; and, after
inspecting the corps in the field, entertained the officers
at dinner.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Louis XVI. had been decapitated, and
the progress of democracy menaced Europe with universal
anarchy. On the 1st of February the National
Convention of France declared war against Great
Britain and Holland, and the British Government
prepared for hostilities. A large army was sent, under
the command of the Duke of York, to join the Austrian
and Prussian allies. Several engagements occurred,
and the French gained possession of the
Austrian Netherlands. Holland opened her principal
towns to the enemy, and they were garrisoned by
French troops.</p>

<p>In September, 1793, the <em>flank</em> companies of the
<span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment embarked for Barbadoes, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
the purpose of taking part in the capture of the French
West India Islands.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1794</div>

<p>In the beginning of 1794 an armament was assembled
at Barbadoes, of which the <em>flank</em> companies of the
<span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> formed part, and early in February the
expedition, under Admiral Sir John Jervis and General
Sir Charles (afterwards Earl) Grey, sailed for <em>Martinique</em>.
After some sharp fighting the island was taken
possession of by General Sir Charles Grey, on the 22nd
of March.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>From Martinique the <em>grenadiers</em>, under Prince Edward
(afterwards Duke of Kent), the <em>light</em> infantry,
under Major-General Dundas, and three other regiments,
embarked on the 30th of March for <em>St. Lucia</em>,
where they arrived on the 1st of April, and the conquest
of that island was effected in three days; His
Royal Highness Prince Edward, with his brigade of
grenadiers, and Major-General Dundas, with his brigade
of light infantry, taking possession of St. Lucia on the
4th of April. The flank companies of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>
regiment were afterwards employed in the reduction
of the island of <em>Guadaloupe</em>. A determined
resistance was made by the enemy; but the island was
captured by the 20th of April.</p>

<p>France did not view with indifference the loss of
these valuable possessions, and in June a French armament
arrived at <em>Guadaloupe</em> for the recovery of that
island. The light company, under Brevet Lieut.-Colonel
Andrew Ross, highly distinguished itself on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
night of the 13th of June, in attacking the enemy near
<em>Point-à-Petre</em>. General Sir Charles Grey stated in his
despatch:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Brevet Major Ross,<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment,
who was with the light infantry, behaved with great
gallantry and good conduct on this occasion, as he has
done on every other.”</p>
</div>

<p>The light company also participated in a night attack
on Fort <em>Fleur d’Epée</em> between the 25th and 26th of
June; on the day following, Brigadier-General Symes,
with the grenadiers and light infantry, attacked the
enemy, who was driven to Morne Mascot, where he again
made resistance, but being charged with the bayonet,
he fled into Fort Fleur d’Epée.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel Ross, of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>, commanded
the second battalion of light infantry on these occasions.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel Colin Graham, of the twenty-first
Royal North British Fusiliers, was appointed to the
command of the troops in Basse Terre, and he
defended <em>Berville</em> camp with the utmost gallantry until
the 6th of October, when he was forced to surrender,&mdash;his
force having become reduced by excessive exertion,
and the unhealthiness of the climate, to one hundred
and twenty-five rank and file fit for duty.</p>

<p>The troops at Guadaloupe suffered severely from the
climate, and the arduous duties they had to perform,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
and could only muster 389 soldiers fit for duty on the
1st of September.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>By the articles of capitulation the British troops
were to march out with the honors of war, and it was
agreed to send the garrison to England on board
French ships, as soon as transports were ready. The
latter part of the agreement was not, however, complied
with, as they remained prisoners for more than
a year afterwards, during which time many of them
died. The garrison consisted of the flank companies of
the 17th, 31st, and 34th regiments; the 39th, 43rd,
56th (three companies), and 65th regiments. Their
loss in the different actions between the 27th of September
and the 6th of October amounted to two
officers killed and five wounded; twenty-five non-commissioned
officers and privates killed, and fifty-one
wounded.</p>

<p>During the year 1794 Lieutenants Davies, Mackenzie,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
and Williams, of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment, died of
fever contracted in the West Indies.</p>

<p>The whole island of Guadaloupe, with the exception
of Fort Matilda, had been recaptured by the French:
this fort was defended by the troops under Lieut.-General
Prescott until the 10th of December, when
it was evacuated by the British.</p>

<p>On the 12th of July, 1794, the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>
regiment embarked at Wexford for England, disembarked
at Bristol, and marched thence to Southampton.</p>

<p>The regiment, on the 25th of July, 1794, was
augmented to ten battalion and two flank companies;
and on the 17th of August following embarked for
Holland, where it was stationed at Middleburg and
Flushing, in the island of Walcheren, but was not
employed on any particular duty.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1795</div>

<p>In this year the regiment returned to England, and
landed at Plymouth on the 27th of February, 1795.</p>

<p>A camp was formed in the month of August, at
Nursling, near Southampton, which the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>
regiment joined on the 25th of that month, and received
a reinforcement to its strength in drafts from
the 43rd, 88th, 92nd, and 94th regiments, which raised
its establishment to 1000 rank and file, with a second
lieutenant-colonel, a major, and one additional lieutenant
to each company, besides two recruiting
companies.</p>

<p>On the 25th of October, 1795, the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>
regiment embarked for the West Indies, as part of the
armament which had been prepared for the deliverance
of the French West India Islands from the power of
republicanism, and to reduce to obedience the insurgents
of St. Vincent and Grenada. The expedition,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
commanded by Lieut.-General Sir Ralph Abercromby,
sailed with the immense fleet, under the
convoy of a squadron of the Royal Navy, commanded
by Rear-Admiral Sir Hugh Christian. The troops
amounted to about 25,000 men, in the highest state of
equipment; and the armament on quitting the British
shores presented a magnificent spectacle, calculated to
impress the mind with a just idea of the power of
England; but it unfortunately happened that the
voyage had been delayed until a very late period of the
year; three attempts were made to get under weigh,
and each was prevented by the violence of the weather:
many ships were driven from their anchors and
stranded.</p>

<p>Three hundred sail got under weigh on the 11th of
November, when an accident to the Admiral rendered
the attempt of no avail. On the 15th another endeavour
was overcome by the tempestuous weather.
At length the fleet sailed, but it had scarcely got clear
of the Isle of Wight, when another severe storm obliged
the vessels that had ridden through it with safety to
return to Portsmouth.</p>

<p>With great difficulty and exertion Admiral Christian
collected the remainder of his convoy, and again sailed
on the 9th of December, but four days afterwards a
storm destroyed many of the transports, and so scattered
the fleet as to render a re-union impossible.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1796</div>

<p>Lieut.-General Sir Ralph Abercromby sailed in
the “Arethusa” frigate, with such vessels as could be
collected, and on the 14th of March, 1796, arrived at
Barbadoes.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment, having weathered the
storm, which had dispersed the fleet in the Channel,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
proceeded on the voyage, but was unable to make good
the passage, and on the 5th of February, 1796, after
being six weeks at sea struggling against the violent
tempests, the regiment was landed at Gosport, whence
it marched to Poole, in Dorsetshire; the regiment was
not long inactive, as on the 19th of March it was
again on board ship at Southampton, and proceeded
to its original destination.</p>

<p>On the 1st of May the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> arrived off
the island of <em>St. Lucia</em>, on which Lieut.-General Sir
Ralph Abercromby had already effected a landing.
The regiment disembarked immediately, under the
command of Lieut.-Colonel Hay, and was cantoned
near the point of disembarkation at Choc Bay. The
fortress of <em>Morne Fortunée</em> was invested by Lieut.-General
Sir Ralph Abercromby; <em>Morne Chabot</em>, another
strong position, having been carried with great gallantry
by Brigadier-General (afterwards Sir John)
Moore.</p>

<p>The batteries against <em>Morne Fortunée</em> were opened
on the 14th of May, and on the night of the 17th the
strong outpost of <em>La Vigie</em> was assaulted. The <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>
regiment marched from its position, near Choc
Bay, at sunset, for the purpose of a night-attack upon
this post, which was remarkably strong. It formed a
peninsula, accessible only by a narrow isthmus, and
commanded the entrance on one side of the Carenage
harbour. The post was defended by two batteries;
the first placed midway upon the acclivity, and the
second on the summit of the height. The approaches
to both were by a circuitous path, and the guide who
accompanied the regiment was mortally wounded by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
the first fire from the enemy’s piquet stationed on the
isthmus. The regiment, being ignorant of the country,
missed the proper direction. Lieut.-Colonel Hay
ordered it to ascend the hill <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en force</i>, which was done,
although attended with great difficulty from the precipitous
nature of the ground. The first battery was
gallantly carried by storm, and the enemy retired to
the higher one. The regiment was unfortunately
separated in the ascent, and was unable to make a
concentrated and effectual attack upon the works that
crowned the height, which it nevertheless, in spite of all
obstacles, bravely attempted, but the enemy’s grape-shot
took such effect that the regiment was obliged to
withdraw, after a severe struggle.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> had Captains Johnson and Walker,
four serjeants, and eighty rank and file <em>killed</em>; Lieut.-Colonels
Hay and Arbuthnot, Captains Murray and
Sorrell, Lieutenants Sullivan and Hawkshaw, four
serjeants, and one hundred and twenty-one rank and
file <em>wounded</em>.</p>

<p>On the 25th of May the island of St. Lucia capitulated,
and the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>, forty-fourth, forty-eighth,
and fifty-fifth regiments, under Brigadier-General
Moore, were selected to occupy the place.
The possession of the island was not a quiet one; small
bodies of French, who had deserted from the different
fortresses at their capitulation, withdrew into the
interior, and joined the runaway slaves and Caribs;
taking advantage of the impenetrable nature of the
country, they formed themselves into bands for the
purpose of molesting the British, and plundering the
planters and other residents of the island. Brigadier-General<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
Moore took the field, and penetrated with his
force into the wildest quarters of the mountains, in
order to eradicate these predatory bands.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> was employed on this harassing
duty, and suffered much from fatigue, privation, and
continual exposure; on the service being concluded,
the regiment went into quarters at <em>Vieux Fort</em>, and
other posts, when it became so unhealthy that the
authorities were compelled to remove the corps from
the island. The deaths among the men were for a
time sixteen each day; on the embarkation of the regiment,
on the 22nd of December, for Barbadoes, it had
scarcely a soldier fit for duty; and on its disembarkation
there, six days afterwards, it became necessary
to send the entire regiment into hospital, which was
the <em>second</em> time the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> had been rendered
unserviceable from sickness, the corps having suffered
in a similar manner while stationed in Florida in the
year 1765.</p>

<p>During the year 1796 the regiment had lost seventeen
officers, and eight hundred and seventy men,
including those who fell in the attack of <em>La Vigie</em>, in
St. Lucia.</p>

<p>In the previous year Prussia had concluded a peace
with the French republic, and, in consequence of the
United Provinces of Holland having leagued with
France, England had taken possession of the Cape of
Good Hope; in February, 1796, the island of Ceylon
was also captured from the Dutch by Great Britain.
The former allies of England now became converted
into enemies. War was declared by Holland, which
had been constituted the Batavian republic, against
Great Britain in May, and Spain followed the example<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
in October. In the same month <ins class="corr" id="tn-54" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'Lord Malmsbury'">
Lord Malmesbury</ins> was sent to Paris to negotiate a peace on the part of the
British Government, but the French insisted upon
retaining, as integral parts of the republic, the conquests
lately made: these terms could not be acceded to consistently
with the general interests of Europe, and
the negotiation was discontinued.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1797</div>

<p>On the 14th of February, 1797, the combined fleets of
France and Spain were defeated off Cape St. Vincent,
by Admiral Sir John Jervis, afterwards created Earl
St. Vincent, on account of this glorious victory, for
which the honor of knighthood was also conferred on
Commodore (afterwards Admiral Viscount) Nelson. On
the 18th of February the Spanish island of Trinidad
surrendered to a British force under Lieut.-General
Sir Ralph Abercromby.</p>

<p>In April, 1797, Austria signed the preliminaries of
peace with the French Republic, and, in July, Lord
Malmesbury was sent a second time to negotiate a treaty,
but the demands of the French Directory rendered the
attempt abortive.</p>

<p>In the year 1797 the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment, greatly
reduced in numbers, embarked for England and landed
at Gravesend in July; it mustered only <em>eighty-five</em> men,
including serjeants, drummers, and rank and file.
Shortly after disembarkation the regiment marched to
Doncaster, and remained at stations between that place,
Hull, and York, for the two following years.</p>

<p>In this year alarming mutinies occurred on board the
fleet at Spithead and the Nore, but the British seamen
nobly redeemed their character on the 11th of October,
1797, in the victory gained by Admiral Duncan (who
was in consequence created Viscount Duncan), over the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
Dutch fleet, off Camperdown, which was proceeding
to join that of the French at Brest.</p>

<p>On the 17th of October the definitive treaty of
peace between Austria and the French republic was
signed at Campo Formio, so that Great Britain was
left to continue the contest single-handed with France
and her allies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1798</div>

<p>The threat of invasion, renewed by France, called
forth the patriotic feelings of the British nation; the
militia force was increased, and volunteer corps were
formed in every part of the kingdom.</p>

<p>Napoleon Bonaparte, against whose legions in the
Peninsula, in subsequent years, the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment
acquired great renown, was now rising step by
step to that Imperial sway which he afterwards attained.
The French Directory, jealous of his ambition,
sent him on the expedition to Egypt, with the view of
acting from that country against the British empire in
India. Napoleon took Alexandria by storm, and soon
established himself at Cairo. The Sublime Porte, incensed
by the invasion of Egypt, declared war against
France, and formed an alliance with Russia. The fleet,
which had conveyed the expedition to Egypt, was
almost destroyed by Admiral Nelson in <em>Aboukir Bay</em>
on the 1st of August. So large a portion of the French
army being thus secluded in a distant land, gave fresh
impulse to the Allies, and in November the island of
<em>Minorca</em> surrendered to the British arms. In December
the co-operation of Russia against France was
secured by Great Britain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1799</div>

<p>At this period of the war the soldiers of the English
militia regiments were permitted to extend their
services to the regular army;&mdash;the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
received eight hundred and fifty-three volunteers
from the militia.</p>

<p>In March, 1799, war was declared by the French
Directory against Austria, and the combined Austrian
and Russian armies were so successful as to recover
the greater portion of Italy.</p>

<p>In August, 1799, a corresponding attempt was made
by Great Britain to recover Holland from the dominion
of France, and a numerous army was selected to proceed
to that country, under His Royal Highness the
Duke of York. Previously to the arrival of the Duke
of York, the army was commanded by Lieut.-General
Sir Ralph Abercromby, K.B., with the local rank of
General.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment marched to Deal, embarked
for Holland on the 8th of September, and
arrived at the Helder on the 15th of the same month.
The <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> and other regiments were embarked
after the departure of General Sir Ralph Abercromby,
in order to reinforce his army. The Duke of York,
having preceded these additional troops by two days, was
already in command of the army, which was intrenched
in the advance of the Helder on the Zuype, in which
lines Sir Ralph Abercromby had, on the 10th of September,
near the village of <em>Crabbendam</em>, repulsed the
attack of the French and Dutch under General Brune.</p>

<p>Immediately on landing, the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> marched
to the lines, and joined Major-General the Earl of
Chatham’s brigade, in the division of General Sir
Ralph Abercromby, on the 15th of September.
The Duke of York, having been reinforced by the
expected arrival of a corps of twelve thousand Russians,
under Lieut.-General Hermann, resolved on attacking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
the French position in advance of <em>Alkmaar</em>, reaching
from Zuyder-Zee on the right, to Camperdown on the
left, and embracing the town of Bergen.</p>

<p>The attack was made on the 19th of September, in
four columns: the right, formed entirely of Russians,
under Lieut.-General Hermann, moved on Bergen;
the centre divisions, under Lieut.-General Dundas
and Lieut.-General Sir James Pulteney, forced the
village and post of Oude Carspel, on the road to
Alkmaar; while the left column, in which was the
<span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment, under General Sir Ralph
Abercromby, advanced to the capture of Hoorne.</p>

<p>The point of attack selected for Sir Ralph Abercromby’s
division being at a considerable distance
beyond the extent of the line, the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>,
and other regiments, marched at eight o’clock on
the night of the 18th of September, and the movement
was performed with such skill and secrecy, that
Hoorne was surprised and carried on the following
morning without loss, which placed the French position
in considerable peril. The Russians having failed in
holding Bergen, after having entered it in gallant
style, rendered it impossible for the centre division to
continue in possession of the posts it had acquired.
The British troops were therefore withdrawn to their
former lines upon the Zuype, to which the Russians
had retreated. Hoorne was evacuated, and the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>,
with the other regiments of Sir Ralph Abercromby’s
division, returned on the night of the 19th of
September to the ground they had quitted on the
former evening.</p>

<p>From the 20th of September until the 1st of
October, both armies remained within their intrenchments,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
strengthening their lines of defence; the French
had received reinforcements, and had inundated a
large tract of country on their right by cutting the
sluices, thus contracting the ground of operations to
six or seven miles.</p>

<p>The Duke of York, on the 2nd of October, made
another attack on the French position between <em>Bergen</em>
and <em>Egmont-op-Zee</em>. The combined attacks were made
in four columns; the division under General Sir
Ralph Abercromby, being on the right, marched
along the beach. The left of the French army was
posted and concentrated about Bergen, a large village
surrounded by extensive woods, through which passed
the great road leading to Haarlem; between which
and the sea was an extensive region of high sand-hills
impassable for artillery. Behind the sand-hills, and to
the enemy’s right, through the whole extent of North
Holland, lies a wet and low country, intersected with
dykes, canals, and ditches. The French centre was
supported by the town of Alkmaar. The battle soon
became serious in front of <em>Bergen</em>, upon which Lieut.-General
Dundas had been ordered to proceed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Sir Ralph Abercromby had passed
Bergen in order to turn the position of the French at
<em>Alkmaar</em>, and overcame every opposition until he
reached <em>Egmont-op-Zee</em>, which post was occupied in
great numbers, and gallantly defended. Sir Ralph
Abercromby, however, here overthrew a corps of the
French army, and wheeling his division to the left,
turned the enemy’s position at <em>Bergen</em>, upon which
General Brune, the commander-in-chief of the French
and Batavian army, fell back, taking up an equally
strong position at a short distance to the rear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span></p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment had an opportunity of
distinguishing itself particularly throughout this
arduous contest, which lasted from six in the morning
until the same hour in the evening. In the attack of
Bergen, the regiment took two pieces of artillery from
the enemy; the corps on the right frequently charged
with the bayonet, and lost a great number of men.
The <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment had one serjeant and
twenty-seven rank and file <em>killed</em>; Captain Smith,
Ensign King, and fifty-five rank and file <em>wounded</em>.</p>

<p>During the night of the 2nd of October, Bergen
and Egmont-op-Zee were evacuated by the enemy.</p>

<p>The army remained during the night on the ground
it held at the close of the battle, and on the 3rd of
October <em>Alkmaar</em> was occupied by detachments of
British troops. On the 6th of October, the advanced
posts in front of Alkmaar, Egmont-op-Hooff, and
Egmont-op-Zee, were pushed forward, preparatory to
a general forward movement. At first little opposition
was shown, and the British took possession of some
villages, and of a position on the sand-hills near Wyck-op-Zee;
but the column of Russian troops, under the
command of Major-General D’Essen, in endeavouring
to gain a height in front of their intended advanced
post at Baccum, was vigorously opposed, and afterwards
attacked by a strong body of the enemy.</p>

<p>This movement obliged General Sir Ralph Abercromby
to move up in support with the reserve of
his corps; the French advanced their whole force;
the action became general along the whole line from
Limmen to the sea, and was maintained with great
obstinacy on both sides until night, when the enemy
retired, leaving the British masters of the field of battle.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
The <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment, on the 6th of October,
had Lieutenant Forster, one serjeant, and thirty-five
rank and file <em>killed</em>; Captain Pickering, Lieutenants
Mullins, Walker, Ball, Ensigns Williams and
Johnson, three serjeants, and eighty-four rank and file
<em>wounded</em>.</p>

<p>In the meantime the French army had been reinforced;
the state of the weather, the ruined condition
of the roads, the total want of the necessary supplies,
offered great obstacles; besides which, the efforts
which had been made for the liberation of Holland
were not seconded by the Dutch people, so that it was
determined to withdraw the British army. A convention
was ultimately concluded with General Brune at
Alkmaar, on the 18th of October.</p>

<p>On the 16th of November the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment
embarked at the Texel, and landed at Deal three days
afterwards, when it marched immediately to Canterbury,
where the effects of the Dutch campaign began
to be perceptible. Before the army left Holland
dysentery had broken out among the men, arising from
their exposure to the damp and fogs natural to the
country. The <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> lost a great number of
men, from this cause, while stationed at Canterbury.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1800</div>

<p>On the 15th of May, 1800, the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment
embarked at Dover for Ireland, landed at Cove
on the 6th of June, and marched directly to Cork, where
a force was collecting for a secret service, to which it
was added. On the 27th of June the embarkation
took place, and on the 8th of July the armament
reached the Bay of Quiberon; the twenty-third, <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>,
fifty-second, and sixty-third regiments landed on
the Isle de Houat, where they remained encamped,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
under the command of Brigadier-General the Honorable
Thomas Maitland, until the 19th of August,
when they again embarked and joined the expedition
under Lieut.-General Sir James Pulteney, destined
for the coast of Spain. A landing was effected at
<em>Ferrol</em> on the 25th of August; the troops advanced to
the heights which overlook the town, and the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>
had some skirmishing with the enemy’s piquets.
After viewing the town and its defences, Sir James
Pulteney abandoned the idea of attacking the place;
the troops were re-embarked on the following morning,
and the fleet sailed for Vigo, where it arrived on the
27th of August. Here General Sir Ralph Abercromby
joined with other troops, and assumed the
command of the whole force. After remaining in Vigo
Bay for some time, the fleet sailed for Cadiz, where it
arrived on the 3rd of October. Sir Ralph Abercromby
summoned the Governor to surrender, but an epidemic
fever was raging in the city, and the fleet quitted the
coast for fear of infection, and proceeded to Gibraltar.</p>

<p>At this period General Sir Ralph Abercromby
received orders from the British Government to
proceed to Egypt; but the three battalions of the
ninth foot, the second battalion of the twenty-seventh,
the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>, and two battalions of the fifty-second
regiment, being composed principally of volunteers from
the militia, whose conditions of enlistment limited their
services to time and place, were not available for the
expedition to Egypt: they were accordingly ordered to
proceed to Lisbon, where they arrived on the 27th of
November, having suffered much from confinement on
board ship, and the use of salt provisions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1801</div>

<p>On the 27th of January, 1801, the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
again at sea, and on the 14th of February disembarked
at Minorca, which had surrendered to Great Britain in
November, 1798; this island was restored to Spain at
the Peace of 1802.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1802</div>

<p>The successes of the British arms in Egypt, by which
the French were expelled from that country, were
followed by a Treaty of Peace, which was signed on the
27th of March, 1802, at Amiens, between the French
Republic, Spain, and the Batavian Republic, on the
one part, and Great Britain on the other. The principal
features of the treaty were, that Great Britain restored
all her conquests during the war, excepting Trinidad
and Ceylon, which were ceded to her, the former by
Spain, and the latter by the Batavian Republic.
Portugal was maintained in its integrity, excepting
that some of its possessions in Guiana were ceded to
France. The territories of the Ottoman Porte were
likewise maintained in their integrity. The Ionian
Republic was recognised, and Malta was to be restored
to the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem. The French
agreed to evacuate the Neapolitan and Roman states,
and Great Britain all the ports that she held in the
Adriatic and the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>In May, 1802, the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment sailed from
Minorca for England, and early in June landed at
Portsmouth, on the 19th of which month it was reduced
to the Peace Establishment.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1803</div>

<p>In the year 1803 the regiment was removed to
Jersey.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span></p>

<p>Napoleon Bonaparte was now approaching the zenith
of his power: the unsettled state of affairs in France
had induced him to quit his army in Egypt, and on
his return the Directory was abolished, Bonaparte
being appointed First Consul of the French Republic.
This occurred in 1799, and in the following year
Europe was astounded by his daring passage of the
Alps, followed by the victory of Marengo, which caused
Austria to sue for peace.</p>

<p>The French being driven from Egypt in 1801 by
the gallant Abercromby and his brave troops, in which
the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment would probably have shared,
had it not been for the circumstances stated at <a href="#Page_61">page 61</a>,
the Peace of Amiens was concluded; it, however, gave
but a slight interval of tranquillity to Europe. The
military spirit of the French nation had been aroused
by the genius of Napoleon, who endeavoured to realize
his schemes for the aggrandizement of France;&mdash;and
England appeared as a barrier to his designs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span></p>

<p>In May, 1803, the war was renewed; Hanover was
overrun by the French, and severed for a time from
the British Crown. An immense flotilla was also
assembled at Boulogne for the invasion of England.
The threat of invasion aroused the patriotism of the
British people, and the most strenuous measures were
pursued to defeat the French ruler’s designs; the
“<em>Army of Reserve Act</em>” was passed in June, 1803, for
raising men for home service by ballot; numerous
volunteer and yeomanry corps were formed in every
part of the kingdom; and all party differences merged
into one universal effort for the preservation of Great
Britain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1804</div>

<p>On the 18th of May, 1804, Napoleon was invested
with the dignity of <em>Emperor of the French</em>, and on the
26th of May of the following year he was crowned
<em>King of Italy</em> at Milan.</p>

<p>Further measures of defence were adopted by Great
Britain, and the “<em>Additional Force Act</em>” was passed on
the 14th of July, 1804, by which a <em>second battalion</em> was
added to the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment, to be formed of
men raised in the county of Chester, for limited service.</p>

<p>The regiment embarked at Jersey for England on
the 9th of November, and on the 27th of that month
arrived at Portsmouth, whence it marched to Winchester,
and received a further number of volunteers
from the Militia.</p>

<p>On the 12th of December the Court of Spain issued
a declaration of war against England, in consequence
of the capture of some frigates off Cadiz, which had
been intercepted while on their way to France with
cargoes of treasure,&mdash;Spain having agreed to furnish a
powerful aid to Napoleon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span></p>

<div class="sidenotex">1805</div>

<p>By July, 1805, the second battalion was fully embodied,
and in October proceeded from Chester to
Winchester, where the first battalion was stationed.</p>

<p>While the French were pursuing their victorious
career in Germany, they experienced dreadful reverses
from the navy of Great Britain. On the 21st of
October the combined fleets of France and Spain were
completely defeated off Cape <em>Trafalgar</em>. The victory
was, however, clouded by the death of Admiral
Viscount Nelson, to whose memory the highest honors
were paid by a grateful and admiring nation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1806</div>

<p>On the 9th of January, 1806, the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment
was present at the funeral of Admiral Viscount
Nelson, and formed part of the line between which the
procession passed on its way to St. Paul’s Cathedral,
in which the Admiral’s remains were interred, and
where a monument was erected by order of Parliament.</p>

<p>In November of the preceding year a squadron of
English and Russian vessels landed some troops at
Naples without any opposition from the Neapolitan
Court. The French Emperor, on receiving intelligence
of this transaction, issued a proclamation that
“<em>the Neapolitan dynasty had ceased to reign</em>,” and an
army, under his brother, Joseph Bonaparte, assisted
by Marshal Massena, marched for Naples. On the
15th of February the French entered that capital, and
soon obtained possession of the whole kingdom, excepting
Gaeta; Ferdinand IV. and his Court having previously
retired to Sicily. A decree was shortly issued by
Napoleon, conferring the crown of Naples on his brother
Joseph, who was proclaimed King on the 30th of May.</p>

<p>England being desirous of preserving Sicily from
the dominion of France, troops were embarked for that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
island;&mdash;on the 26th of April the <em>first battalion</em> of the
<span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment embarked at Tilbury-fort, and
landed at Messina on the 26th of July.</p>

<p>Previously to the arrival of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>
regiment, the French had assembled a force in Calabria
for the invasion of Sicily, and Major-General
Stuart, commanding the British troops in that island,
formed the design of cutting off the French division
under General Regnier; the result was the battle of
<em>Maida</em>, where a victory was gained by the British troops
on the 4th of July. Major-General Stuart being
sensible that he could not, with his small force,
maintain himself in Calabria, recrossed the straits of
Messina and returned to Sicily. For this victory
Major-General John Stuart received the dignity of
Knight of the Bath, the thanks of Parliament, and was
created Count of Maida by the King of the Two Sicilies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1807</div>

<p>Admiral Sir John Duckworth having failed in his
coercive mission to detach Turkey from the interests of
France, Great Britain determined to seize upon Egypt,
as a check to any fresh demonstration by the French
against the British possessions in the East Indies.</p>

<p>An armament accordingly sailed from Melazzo, on
the coast of Sicily, in February, 1807, under the
command of Major-General Alexander Mackenzie
Fraser, Colonel of the seventy-eighth regiment, and
landed at Aboukir on the 18th of March. On the 21st
of March, Alexandria was occupied by the British
troops, and it is a singular coincidence that it was the
anniversary of the battle fought near there in the year
1801, when the gallant General Sir Ralph Abercromby
received the wound which terminated his honorable
career.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span></p>

<p>On the 27th of March a force of fifteen hundred
men, of which the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment formed part,
was detached under the command of Major-General
Wauchope to Rosetta. The troops arrived before the
city on the 31st of March, and not having been impeded
in their progress to the environs, entered the
place. The <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment marched into Rosetta,
while the grenadier battalion occupied a high
sandy mound without the city.</p>

<p>Rosetta is situated upon a slight eminence, commanding
a view of the river Nile and the fertile lands
of the Delta; the streets are somewhat wider than the
generality of Egyptian towns, and planted here and
there with trees. The houses are high, the lower half
of each being a dead wall, with a small door, leading
into a narrow passage, well secured with bolts and bars
of iron. The chambers are above, with trelliced windows
projecting over the streets. The Turks had garrisoned
their houses, and remaining quiet, allowed the British
to continue their march until some way into the town,
when through the loop-holes they had constructed on
purpose, and their trelliced windows, a destructive and
unexpected fire was opened upon the column. The
troops, although placed in a most trying and perilous
situation, behaved extremely well, and after having
suffered very materially in killed and wounded, retired
to Aboukir, from whence they returned to Alexandria.</p>

<p>Major-General Wauchope, who commanded the
force, was killed; the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment had
Captain John Robertson, three serjeants, three drummers,
and sixty-nine rank and file <em>killed</em>; Captain
Patrick Dowdall, Lieutenants Edward Knox, Peter
Fearon, John Thornton, &mdash;&mdash; Sladden, and Francis Ryan,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
Ensign Richard Kirby, seven serjeants, one drummer,
and one hundred and twenty-nine rank and file <em>wounded</em>.
Lieutenant Sladden subsequently died of his wounds.</p>

<p>Brigadier-General the Honorable Robert Meade
(Lieutenant-Colonel of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>), the second
in command, was also severely wounded.</p>

<p>Major-General Fraser finding that a famine would
be the consequence of the British remaining at Alexandria,
without the occupation of Rosetta, detached
another body of troops, amounting to two thousand
five hundred men, under Brigadier-General the Honorable
William Stewart, to reduce the place. The force
consisted of a detachment of Royal Artillery, a detachment
of the twentieth light dragoons, light infantry
battalion, first battalion of the thirty-fifth regiment,
second battalion of the seventy-eighth regiment, the
Baron De Roll’s regiment, and a detachment of seamen.
A large Turkish force coming down the Nile from
Cairo, the troops were compelled to retire, fighting all
the way to Alexandria.</p>

<p>A formidable force now approached Alexandria, and
Major-General Fraser sent a flag of truce offering to
evacuate Egypt, on condition that the British prisoners
should be liberated. The proposal was readily accepted,
and on the 19th of September the British troops
embarked for Sicily, where they arrived on the 16th of
October.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1808</div>

<p>The first battalion of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment
embarked from Sicily for Malta, on the 17th of September,
1808, where it remained until August, 1810,
when it returned to Sicily.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1810<br />1811</div>

<p>On the 17th of August, 1810, the first battalion
landed at Messina, and remained in garrison in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
citadel until April, 1811, when Lieut.-General Lord
William Bentinck, being about to proceed to the eastern
coast of Spain, sent it to Malta, in order that a stronger
corps might be drawn from that island, the thirty-first
having been reduced considerably in numbers
while stationed in the Mediterranean. The battalion
landed at Malta on the 18th of April, but the force left
in Sicily being found insufficient, four companies were
immediately recalled, and on the 22nd of April re-embarked
for Messina; a few months afterwards the
head-quarters were ordered back to Sicily, and on the
28th of August joined the detached companies, when
the battalion was once more united in Sicily.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1812</div>

<p>About this period the British authorities in Sicily
detected the traces of a conspiracy set on foot the year
before by the Queen of Naples, who, it is said, had
proposed a scheme to Napoleon for massacring the
English. A new constitution was established in Sicily,
upon the model of that of Great Britain, under the
auspices of Lieut.-General Lord William Bentinck,
who had been appointed Captain-General of the
Island, and the Queen was sent into retirement.</p>

<p>In November, 1812, the grenadier company of the
<span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment embarked from Sicily for the
east coast of Spain, under Lieut.-General Frederick
Maitland, and landed at Alicant on the 2nd of
December. In April, 1813, it returned to Sicily, where
it arrived in May.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1813</div>

<p>The first battalion of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment
remained in garrison in the citadel of Messina until
towards the end of 1813, when, in consequence of disturbances
at Palermo, the capital of Sicily, which
threatened to spread, the troops were detached to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
various central positions. The <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>, by a
detour, marched upon Castro Giovanni, and remained
there until January, 1814, when the battalion returned
to Messina.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1814</div>

<p>On the 28th of March, 1814, the battalion embarked
at Melazzo, as part of an expedition destined for the
shores of Italy, under Lieut.-General Lord William
Bentinck. In the beginning of April the first division
of the army arrived off the coast above and below the
city of Genoa, and threatened a descent upon <em>Voltri</em>,
rather to engage the attention of the enemy, however,
in that quarter, than for any other purpose.</p>

<p>On the 5th of April the second division of the Anglo-Sicilian
army disembarked at Leghorn, and marched
directly upon Sestri. The French reinforced that
place to protect the coast batteries, and prevent the
British communicating with the people of the
mountains, who were ready to rise against the French.
The two British divisions had united, and attacked the
enemy, on the 8th of April, at <em>Sestri</em>; the battle
lasted throughout the day, and in the night the French
General Ronger St. Victor retired towards Recco,
taking up his position in rear of Rafallo, where he left
his advanced guard; a third British division, in which
was the first battalion of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>, hovered
about the coast, and made some attempts to land fresh
troops, but was prevented by the enemy’s detachments
at Recco.</p>

<p>On the 9th and 10th of April the squadron cannonaded
<em>Recco</em>, but was obliged to stand out again;
in the night of the 10th General Pègot, who had
arrived to relieve General Ronger St. Victor, retired,
and occupied, on the 11th of April, a position at Mount<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
Fascia. The English squadron and transports had all
arrived before <em>Genoa</em>, and a detachment from the
divisions on shore had been able to communicate with
the native levies at Fontana Buona. On the 12th of
April the position of Mount Fascia was attacked, and,
after a hard day’s contest, General Pègot fell back in
the night, and took up another strong position at <em>La
Sturla</em>, on the heights of Albaro, his right on the sea
being covered by a battery of four pieces of artillery,
and his left resting on Fort Richelieu. The remainder
of the British army disembarked at Nervi, and
immediately attacked the enemy on the heights of
Albaro, on the 13th of April.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>, under the command of Colonel
Bruce, belonged to this division, and, with the 8th
battalion of the Line of the King’s German Legion,
dashed in among the enemy the instant of their debarkation,
notwithstanding the intersected and difficult nature
of the ground, which assisted so materially the
obstinate defence of the French. Meanwhile the light
company of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>, under Captain Nunn,
had carried the battery which covered the enemy’s
right, with conspicuous bravery, and dismounted the
four guns upon it under a galling fire of musketry and
artillery from another battery near that captured.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> had Captains Stewart and Cruice,
three serjeants, one drummer, and thirty-six rank and
file <em>wounded</em>; one serjeant and thirteen rank and file
<em>killed</em>.</p>

<p>The following extract from Division Orders, dated La
Sturla, 14th of April, 1814, bears testimony to the
conduct of the corps:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The conduct of the troops in the long contested
action of yesterday, at <em>La Sturla</em>, was most honorable
to them, and Major-General Montresor feels the
greatest satisfaction in doing justice to their merits,
by publicly declaring his high sense of their persevering
gallantry in surmounting the numberless
obstacles which the broken and intersected nature of
the country presented, in every step, to their advance,
whilst it afforded the best shelter to the enemy, who,
well accustomed to his ground, defended it with the
greatest obstinacy.</p>

<p>“However justly entitled the whole may be to individual
distinction, it nevertheless would be unjust
not to notice, in particular, the ardour and spirited
skill in which the Royal Flotilla, and the detachments
of the third Italian Levy, and of the second and
third extra regiments, and Royal Marines, began
the attack, and the very gallant manner in which
the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment, and the 8th King’s
German Legion, dashed in amongst the enemy after
their debarkation, and the conspicuous bravery of the
light company of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment, in
carrying the battery on the left.”</p>
</div>

<p>During the 14th and 15th of April the attacks upon
the heights of Albaro were repeated, and on the 17th,
while disaffection among the people was rapidly
spreading in Genoa, the posts of St. Francisco and St.
Martin d’Albaro were carried, and the French retired
behind the Bizagno.</p>

<p>By the 18th of April the disaffection in Genoa had
reached a crisis, and upon the following day the advance
upon the city took place. The <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> drove
the enemy from a strong battery of ten brass guns and
two 13½ inch brass mortars, without sustaining any loss.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span></p>

<p>During the night of the 19th of April a convention
was signed; on the morning of the 21st, the enemy
marched out of the city and evacuated all his posts.
On the 22nd the head-quarters of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>
were within the city of Genoa, when the Commander-in-Chief,
Lieut.-General Lord William Bentinck, issued
the order from which the following extract is taken:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="fs80 right">“Head-Quarters, Genoa, 24th April, 1814.</p>

<p>“The Commander of the Forces has much satisfaction
in witnessing the zeal and gallantry evinced
by the whole of the troops under his orders in the
late operations, which have led to the possession of
this important fortress; and he has not failed to
represent their conduct in the most favourable terms
to His Majesty’s government.</p>

<p>“Major-General Montresor has particularly reported
to him the great assistance he received from Brigadier-General
Roth, Colonel Bruce, and Lieut.-Colonel
Travers.</p>

<p>“The Commander of the Forces himself observed
the very gallant and successful attack made by the
third Italian regiment, under the orders of Lieut.-Colonel
Ciravignac, and favourable reports have
been made to him of the conduct of the light company
of the twenty-first regiment, commanded by
Captain Renny, the light company of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>,
under Captain Nunn, and the light company
of the second Estero regiment, under Captain-Lieutenant
Fulghier.”</p>
</div>

<p>On the 27th of April the first battalion of the
<span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> sailed with a force for the island of
Corsica; when the troops arrived opposite Ajaccio,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
that place capitulated. The <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment
then sailed for Bastia (the birth-place of Napoleon),
and landing there on the 11th of May, remained until
the 24th of June following, when it embarked for
Sicily, and again went into garrison in the citadel of
Messina, on the 18th of July, 1814.</p>

<p>In the meantime the brilliant successes gained over
the French in the Peninsula and South of France, by
the troops under the Duke of Wellington, in which the
<em>second</em> battalion of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment bore a
prominent part, led to a treaty of peace with France;
Napoleon retired to Elba, which island was ceded to
him in full sovereignty for life, with a pension payable
from the revenues of France; and on the 3rd of May,
1814, Louis XVIII. entered Paris, and ascended the
throne of his ancestors.</p>

<p>On the 24th of October, 1814, the <em>second</em> battalion
of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment was disbanded at Portsmouth,
and the officers and men fit for service were
transferred to the first battalion, with which they were
incorporated on the 6th of May, 1815, at Messina.</p>

<p>In commemoration of the services of the <em>second</em> battalion
during the Peninsular War, the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>
regiment has received the Royal Authority to bear on
the Regimental Colour and Appointments, the words
“<span class="smcap">Talavera</span>,” “<span class="smcap">Albuhera</span>,” “<span class="smcap">Vittoria</span>,” “<span class="smcap">Pyrenees</span>,”
“<span class="smcap">Nivelle</span>,” “<span class="smcap">Nive</span>,” “<span class="smcap">Orthes</span>,” and “<span class="smcap">Peninsula</span>.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">1815</div>

<p>Although the first and second battalions of the
<span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment were employed in different
countries, yet they were engaged in the promotion of
the same interests, namely, the restoration of the
exiled families of the House of Bourbon to the thrones
of their ancestors; the achievements of the <em>second</em><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
battalion were in the most distinguished arena, but
the <em>first</em> battalion, although it was stationed among
the pastoral beauties of Sicily, and the luxurious
towns of Italy, maintained its discipline and character,
besides adding honors to those formerly acquired on
the field of battle, whenever, as on the heights of
<em>Albaro</em>, an opportunity had offered.</p>

<p>The peace of Europe was again to be disturbed.
The French army retained a chivalrous veneration for
Napoleon, who returned from Elba, landed at Cannes,
in Provence, on the 1st of March, 1815, and was
joined by his former troops. Louis XVIII. withdrew
from Paris to Ghent, and Napoleon assumed his
former dignity of Emperor of the French.</p>

<p>Marshal Murat, the brother-in-law of Napoleon, by
whom in 1808 he had been made King of Naples,
upon Joseph Bonaparte being constituted King of
Spain, had, in January, 1814, signed a treaty with
England, and engaged to co-operate with the allies
against France. Napoleon’s triumphal return to
France caused Murat to espouse his cause, and he at
once commenced hostilities against Austria, issuing a
proclamation asserting the independence of Italy.
Naples was thereupon invested by the Austrians,
while an English squadron entered the port and acted
in co-operation.</p>

<p>The allied powers, however, refused to acknowledge
the sovereignty of Napoleon, and determined on his
dethronement.</p>

<p>These events caused the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment to
be embarked at Melazzo for Naples, where it arrived
on the 25th of May. The city had capitulated to the
British fleet, under Admiral Lord Exmouth, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
troops landed to hold possession until the restoration
of order in the kingdom, and Ferdinand IV. should
be reinstated on the throne of the Two Sicilies.
After an exile of nine years, this sovereign entered
his capital on the 17th of June; on the following day
the hopes of Bonaparte were crushed by his defeat on
the memorable field of Waterloo, which victory
triumphantly closed the campaign; and on the 8th of
July Louis XVIII. re-entered Paris, and the Bourbon
government was restored.</p>

<p>In the beginning of July the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> had
sailed from the Bay of Naples for Genoa, and remained
there to support the arrangements for restoring
the Sardinian dominions to their original state.</p>

<p>Bonaparte was subsequently compelled to surrender
himself a prisoner on the 15th of July to Captain
Maitland, commanding the “Bellerophon” ship of
war, and the island of St. Helena was afterwards
appointed for his residence. Murat’s career was
equally brief; he was driven from Italy, and withdrew
to Corsica, from which island he made a rash descent
on the coast of Calabria. After a sharp action he
and his followers were taken prisoners. Murat was
tried by a military commission, and shot on the 15th
of October.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1816<br />1818</div>

<p>In February, 1816, the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment
embarked for Malta, and remained in that island
until June, 1818, when it proceeded to England, and
landed at Deal on the 22nd of July.</p>

<p>On the return of the regiment to England it was
stationed at Dover Castle, Colchester, Chatham, and
Sheerness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1819</div>

<p>In August, 1819, in consequence of disturbances in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
the manufacturing districts, three companies of the
<span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment proceeded to Manchester, three
to Macclesfield, and three to Stockport. On the 10th
of the same month the regiment was employed in
Manchester.</p>

<p>An assemblage of people, estimated at forty to sixty
thousand, took place on the 16th of August, in an open
space in the town of Manchester, named St. Peter’s
Field, for the purpose of petitioning Parliament. Such
meetings having been forbidden by proclamation some
weeks previously, the military were employed by the
civil authorities in dispersing the crowd of persons who
had entered the town, with banners, some of which
were of a menacing nature.</p>

<p>The troops of the garrison, the fifteenth hussars, the
<span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> and eighty-eighth regiments, with the
Chester and Manchester yeomanry cavalry, were ordered
to be assembled in the vicinity, under the senior officer,
Lieut.-Colonel L’Estrange, of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment.
The yeomanry were engaged during part of the
day in dispersing the multitude, many of whom received
injuries, and eight or ten were killed. The regular
troops behaved with their usual coolness and discipline,
in the delicate and important duty they had to perform.
The thanks of the Prince Regent, and of the Magistrates,
were communicated to the troops in the following
letters:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="fs80 right">“Whitehall, 21st August, 1819.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1820</div>

<p>The disturbances among the manufacturing classes
having subsided, the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment left
Manchester on the 2nd of June, 1820. The troops had
been much harassed throughout the winter, in consequence
of the ill spirit which prevailed among the
people of the surrounding districts, and on the removal
of the regiment the municipal authorities of Manchester
and Salford addressed a letter to Lieut.-Colonel
L’Estrange, expressing their regret at its departure,
and their esteem for its conduct during the eventful
period the corps was stationed in those towns.</p>

<p>On the 10th of June, 1820, the regiment arrived at
Sunderland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1821</div>

<p>In February, 1821, the regiment marched from
Sunderland to Port Patrick, in Scotland, whence, on
the 7th of March, it embarked for Donaghadee, and on
the following morning proceeded to Belfast. While
quartered in this town, the establishment was reduced
from ten companies of sixty-five rank and file, to eight
companies of seventy-two rank and file each.</p>

<p>During the period the head-quarters remained at
Belfast, detachments of the regiment were stationed in
Coleraine, Downpatrick, and Carrickfergus, where they
were employed on the revenue and other duties generally
required from the army in Ireland.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1822</div>

<p>In April, 1822, the regiment was removed from
Belfast and its neighbourhood, occupying fresh quarters
at Armagh, Newry, and Dundalk.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1823<br />1824</div>

<p>The regiment, in October 1823, marched from Armagh
to Naas, and in January, 1824, proceeded to Dublin,
where it occupied Richmond barracks.</p>

<p>In the year 1824 the regiment received orders to
prepare for foreign service:&mdash;the island of Ceylon was,
in the first instance, selected as its destination, but it
was eventually changed to Bengal. On the 20th of
July the left wing of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment
marched to Kingstown, and embarked on board of
transports for Portsmouth, where it arrived on the
26th of July; the right wing, following soon afterwards,
joined on the 2nd of August, and the regiment went
into barracks at Gosport.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1825</div>

<p>On the 12th of January, 1825, the regiment marched
from Gosport for Chatham, where it arrived on the
20th of that month. On the 7th of February the
regiment marched to Gravesend to embark for Calcutta:
the right wing on board the Honorable East India<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
Company’s ship “<i>Kent</i>,” under the command of Lieut.-Colonel
Fearon; the left wing on board the “Scaleby
Castle,” under Major Tovey. The two ships parted
company off Portsmouth at the end of February, and
the “Scaleby Castle,” after making a favourable voyage,
arrived at Sangor, in the mouth of the Hoogley,
on the 7th of June.</p>

<p>The men had been remarkably healthy during the
long confinement on board ship; two only had died
during the passage, and only eight were on the sick
list when the vessel came to anchor. The men were
transferred, after a few days’ delay at <ins class="corr" id="tn-80" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'Saugor Point'">
Sangor Point</ins>, to sloops, a particularly uncomfortable and clumsy description
of vessel, then used to transport troops up
the River Hoogley from the sand-heads, and on the
21st of June they arrived opposite Fort William,
where boats had been prepared to receive them, for
they were not yet destined to land. It was the 26th,
however, before the left wing was able to sail again;
it was therefore five days, during the most trying
season of the year, confined in small thatched boats,
which were moored to the river’s bank: it nevertheless
reached Berhampore on the 2nd of July, with the loss
of only one man.</p>

<p>Berhampore, on the Bhagaritty river, is the cantonment
of the city of Moorshedabad, and in 1825
was the depôt of the regiments on the Bengal establishment,
then on service in Burmah. The companies
of the left wing of the corps took possession of the
barracks, and remained in them till the 22nd of
September.</p>

1<sup>ST</sup> MARCH, 1825.</span><br />
<em>For Cannon’s Military Records.</em></div>
</div>

<p>The voyage of the <em>right</em> wing of the regiment from
England was interrupted very early in its progress by
one of the most unhappy events that <ins class="corr" id="tn-81" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'could befal a'">
could befall a</ins> ship<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
at sea. The <i>Kent</i> took fire on the 1st of March, in the
Bay of Biscay, and was totally destroyed: the accident
was first perceived about ten o’clock <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, towards the
end of a violent gale of wind, when the sea was
disturbed, and the ship rolling heavily.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It was a little before this period that one of the
officers of the ship, with the well-meant intention of
ascertaining that all was fast below, descended with
two of the sailors into the hold, where they carried
with them, for safety, a light in a patent lantern,
and seeing that the lamp burned dimly, took the
precaution to hand it up to the orlop deck to be
trimmed. Having afterwards discovered one of the
spirit casks to be adrift, he sent the sailors for some
billets of wood to secure it, but the ship in their
absence having made a heavy lurch, the officer unfortunately
dropped the light, and letting go his hold
of the cask, in his eagerness to recover the lantern,
it suddenly stove, and the spirits communicating with
the lamp, the whole place was instantly in a blaze.”<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>
</div>

<p>When all hopes of saving the ship vanished, exertions
were made to rescue the troops and the crew. Encouraged
by the noble example of their officers, the soldiers
preserved the utmost order and firmness in their
perilous situation.</p>

<p>During the long and honorable services of the regiment,
no opportunity had occurred to put its discipline
and conduct to such a severe trial, but it brought from
the ordeal a reputation even more distinguished than it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
had previously gained. In the field, when the spirits
of men are excited by the animating circumstances of the
contest, where honor is sure and death uncertain, valour
and good order may be expected; but in the midst of
dangers against which it appeared hopeless to struggle,&mdash;at
a time when no aid appeared, and passively to die
was all that remained,&mdash;the manly resignation, the ready
obedience, and the unfailing discipline&mdash;characteristics
of a good soldier&mdash;evinced by the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>, entitle
the regiment to dwell at some length, in its Record, upon
the events that called forth those admirable qualities.
Although Lieut.-Colonel Fearon and Major M‘Gregor
were most conspicuous, yet all who were on board
deserve that their names should be recorded.</p>

<p>In the following statement is shown the number of
officers and men of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> embarked in the
“Kent,” specifying also the number saved:&mdash;</p>

<p>The following letters will explain the providential
means of escape afforded by the brig <i>Cambria</i>, and do
justice to the humanity and gallantry of Captain Cook,
who commanded it, as well as of his officers and crew.
The name of this gallant officer must ever be held in
great estimation by the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment, to
him, under Providence, it owes the power of being
enabled to record the many high qualities shown by its
members in the extremity from which he rescued them.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="p1 fs80 right">“Brig Cambria, Falmouth, March 4, 1825.</p>

<p class="smcap noindent">“Gentlemen,</p>

<p>“You are aware of my leaving this port on
the 24th ultimo, with passengers and goods for
Mexico, and I beg to acquaint you of my return
here this morning at one o’clock, under the following
circumstances:&mdash;</p>

<p>“On Tuesday last, the 1st instant, being then in
latitude 47° 30′ and longitude 9° 45′, laying-to, with
a strong gale from the westward, under a close-reefed
main-topsail, we discovered a large sail to the westward,
and on approaching found her to have a signal
of distress flying, which induced me immediately to
render every assistance in my power, and on nearing,
found her to be on fire.</p>

<p>“About three <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, being then on her bow, we succeeded
in getting the first boat from the vessel,
which proved to be the Hon. Company’s ship
‘Kent’ (Captain Cobb), of 1400 tons, for Bengal and
China, with troops and passengers amounting, with
the crew, to 637 souls. From three to eight <span class="allsmcap">P.M.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span></span>
the boats were constantly employed in bringing the
people to the ‘Cambria,’ and succeeded in saving
296 officers, non-commissioned officers, and privates
of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment, 46 women and 52
children appertaining to ditto, 19 male and female
private passengers, and Captain Cobb and 139 of the
crew, amounting in all to 553. The flames now
becoming exceedingly fierce, I could not urge the
sailors again to return to the ship, nor deem it at all
prudent for the preservation of the lives already on
board my vessel to remain longer near the ‘Kent,’
expecting her instantly to blow up. By accounts since
made it is supposed that 68 soldiers, 1 woman and 21
children, and 4 of the crew were left when Captain
Cobb quitted the vessel, whose conduct during the
trying occasion is beyond my humble praise, displaying
the greatest coolness and intrepidity, and by his exertions,
and those of Colonel Fearon, the commander of
the troops, who were the last to quit, the women,
children, and passengers were got into the boats;
and they did not leave themselves until their influence
to induce any more to go into them was useless.</p>

<p>“At two <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> the ‘Kent’ blew up, after being
completely enveloped in flames for four hours previously.
The fire originated in the after-hold, where
the spirits were stowed for the use of the troops;
a cask of which breaking adrift, and bursting, the
contents were unfortunately ignited by a candle in a
lantern. I feel the greatest gratification in stating
that the gentlemen and their Cornish miners, in all
36, with my own crew, 11 more, behaved throughout
the trying period with the greatest kindness
in getting the people from the boats, soothing their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
sufferings, giving up their own clothes and beds to
the women and children, volunteering to go into the
boats (which I had good reason to prevent), and
leaving nothing undone to make them as comfortable
as the limited size of my brig would allow (only 200
tons). It would be pleasing also could I speak as
highly of the crew of the ‘Kent,’ but I cannot
refrain from expressing my disappointment of their
conduct (in which I am borne out by Captain Cobb)
derogatory in every respect to the generally received
character of a British seaman,&mdash;by refusing to return
to the ‘Kent’ for the people, after the first trip, and
requiring my utmost exertions and determination to
compel them to renew their endeavours to get out
the soldiers, passengers, and the remainder of their
own shipmates, who were left behind; and it was
only by coercive measures, in conjunction with my
own crew and passengers, and telling them I would
not receive them on board unless they did so, that
they proceeded, though reluctantly, in their duty.
I must, however, except the officers, particularly Mr.
Thomson, fourth mate, and Mr. Phillips, the boatswain,
whose conduct and behaviour, in every respect,
justify my warmest praise.</p>

<p>“It may not be amiss to state that, two hours after
the ship blew up, a soldier’s wife was delivered of a
fine boy on board the ‘Cambria,’ and both mother
and child are doing well.</p>

<p class="smcap noindent">“Sir,</p>

<p>“It is with feelings of the deepest regret I have
to report, for the information of His Royal Highness
the Commander-in-Chief, the melancholy calamity
which has befallen that portion of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>
regiment under my command, embarked on board
the Honorable Company’s ship ‘Kent,’ for conveyance
to Bengal, owing to her loss, she having taken
fire towards the close of a heavy gale of wind on the
1st instant, about noon, in the Bay of Biscay. The
moment it was discovered bursting from the after-hold
of the vessel every possible effort was made to
get it under, and by the immediate application of
wet blankets, soldiers’ great-coats, and other woollen
articles that could be obtained on the emergency, we
had for a short period every reason to hope these
efforts would have proved successful; but, unhappily,
having communicated to the spirits, the hope of extinguishing
it was soon dispelled, and all further
exertion to save the vessel appeared evidently vain;
the conflagration, owing to the state of the weather,
gaining ground so rapidly. Under these circumstances
it became the imperative duty of Captain
Cobb and myself to endeavour to save the lives of as
many of the people as possible, for which purpose
the boats were hoisted out, and some rafts hastily
constructed, and as many of the women and children
put into the former as we could at the moment
assemble. At this instant, by the Divine interposition
of Providence, a sail hove in sight, which,
discerning our perilous situation, came promptly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
down to our relief; and, owing to the persevering
heroism of the commander, at the evident risk of
losing his own vessel, and by the cool and intrepid
conduct of Captain Cobb, whose attentions were
unremitting, a larger portion of the troops than
could even have been anticipated under so unforeseen
a calamity were preserved, though, I lament to
add, sixty-eight men, one woman, and twenty-one
children appear to have perished, exclusive of five
seamen.</p>

<p>“It is some alleviation to our afflictions to be enabled
to state, that the origin of the fire is in no way
attributable to the troops; a pleasing part of my
duty to bear testimony to the cool and subordinate
conduct of both officers and men under my command,&mdash;the
former affording me every aid which so
critical and trying an occasion demanded, and none
more so than Major M‘Gregor, to whose collected
counsel and manly example, throughout this agonizing
scene of distress, I feel greatly indebted.</p>

has received, with sentiments of the deepest concern,
your letter of the 4th instant, communicating the
awful and afflicting calamity which has befallen the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
right wing of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment, embarked
on board the Honorable Company’s ship ‘Kent.’</p>

<p>“I am at the same time to observe, that if anything
could alleviate the measure of His Royal Highness’s
regret at the loss of the many valuable lives which
have perished on this melancholy occasion, it would
be the satisfaction experienced by the Commander-in-Chief
at the safety of so large a proportion of the
detachment, and which, by the happy interposition
of Divine Providence, aided by your own collected
firmness, and the united discipline and courage of
Major M‘Gregor and the officers and men under your
command, have been preserved for the future service
of their country.</p>

he appreciates in the fullest manner the heroic and
humane assistance afforded to you by the master of
the ‘Cambria’ brig; and that it will afford His
Royal Highness the greatest satisfaction to bear
testimony to it in any manner most calculated to
advance the interests, or to do credit to the conduct,
of this individual.</p>

<p>“Arrangements have been made by the Quarter-Master-General
for the transport of the detachment
under your command by sea to Chatham, as soon as
it is possible to obtain the necessary vessels from the
Navy Board for that purpose; and I have further to
acquaint you, that immediate measures will be taken
for sending down to you, by the quickest inland
carriage, the most essential articles of supply and
equipment; and that the Commander-in-Chief will
contribute, by every means in his power, to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>

<p class="fs80 noindent">“Lieut.-Colonel Fearon,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; “Thirty-first Regiment, Falmouth.”</p>
</div>

<p>It was two hours after midnight when the ‘Kent’
blew up; all the individuals of the regiment and of the
crew that it had been possible to save were now on
board the “Cambria;” their number, however, was
diminished by sixty-eight men, one woman, and twenty-one
children:&mdash;about twenty of the former were left on
the poop of the vessel, when it became unsafe for a
vessel to approach her; whence, abandoning themselves
to despair, they would make no exertion to escape; it
was absolutely necessary therefore to leave them:
others had thrown themselves into the sea, and were
drowned before help could be extended to them, or
had come in contact with part of the wreck and had
been killed; while the anxiety of some few to board
the “Cambria” lost them their lives;&mdash;they were
jammed to death between the brig and the boats.
The only woman lost was suffocated in the orlop deck,
with her three children; she was not able to escape.
Among the children lost there were four, three girls
and a boy, the family of Serjeant Jack, an old and
deserving soldier, who had seen much service with the
second battalion in the Peninsula. While the women
and children were being lowered into the boats, Mrs.
Jack fell overboard; the serjeant leaped into the sea
to save his wife, and was not able to return to the ship.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
In the confusion unavoidable on board, the children
were overlooked; missing their parents, they had
sought refuge, it is supposed, in the Colonel’s cabin,
and no one knew, until it was too late, that they were
still on board; for the soldiers were not backward in
giving their aid to save the families of their comrades;
there were instances of men who tied the children of
their brother soldiers on their backs, and, leaping overboard,
swam with their burdens to the boats. There
were indeed proofs among the non-commissioned
officers and soldiers of a fortitude, courage, and good-feeling
that would have done honor to the highest
station. It happened, however, that fourteen of the
men, who had remained on the wreck, were picked up
the following morning, clinging to some portions of it,
by the “Caroline,” a vessel bound from the Mediterranean
to Liverpool, and carried by her into that port.
The lives lost amounted, therefore, to seventy-six, being
two serjeants, two corporals, one drummer, forty-nine
privates, one woman, and twenty-one children, as specified
at <a href="#Page_82">page 82</a>. The “Cambria” was of 200 tons
only; notwithstanding her crowded state, she providentially
reached Falmouth on the third day (the 4th
March), when the regiment landed.</p>

<p>It is needless to observe that nothing was saved from
the wreck, and many had found it difficult to preserve
even the clothes they happened to have on at the time;
the motley and forlorn appearance the corps presented
on its landing, was never equalled,&mdash;at any rate, in the
British army. The kind exertions of the gentry and
residents generally in Falmouth, to soften the sufferings
of the women and children, must ever be remembered
with gratitude by the regiment; the officers are more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
particularly indebted to this calamity for the brotherly
attention and friendship it procured for them from the
officers who then belonged to the Division of Royal
Marines at Chatham, where on the 26th of March it
arrived, having sailed on the 16th of that month in the
“Diadem” transport from Falmouth.</p>

<p>The following letter from the Military Secretary,
Major-General Sir Herbert Taylor, conveying the
sentiments of his Royal Highness the Duke of York of
the conduct of the officers and men of the regiment, will
show that the discipline received approbation from the
quarter from which it was most valuable:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="p2 fs80 right">“Horse-Guards, March 9, 1825.</p>

<p class="smcap noindent">“Sir,</p>

<p>“The Court of Directors of the East India
Company having transmitted to the Commander-in-Chief
the report made to them by Captain Cobb of the
circumstances attending the destruction of the ship
‘Kent’ by fire, on the 1st instant, I have received his
Royal Highness’s commands to assure you of the
high sense his Royal Highness entertains of the
admirable conduct of the detachment of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>
regiment embarked in that ship under your
command, and, more particularly, of the steadiness
and coolness which you evinced, under circumstances so
critical and trying. His Royal Highness is well
aware that no occasion could offer in which the
effects of a well-established system of discipline and
subordination would be more apparent, or in which
they would in a more important degree tend to assist
the efforts of those who so nobly afforded their aid
towards preserving the lives of all concerned;&mdash;and
he desires that you will convey his thanks to the officers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
and soldiers forming the detachment embarked, under
your orders, in the ship ‘Kent,’ and assure them that
he gives them due credit for their orderly and meritorious
conduct. He considers his thanks to be due
more especially to yourself, for the example which you
set them, and for the persevering and gallant exertions
which contributed so essentially to lessen the
sad result of the catastrophe.</p>

<p>“His Royal Highness orders me to add, that he shall
deem it his duty to report to his Majesty a conduct,
on your part and that of the officers and men committed
to your charge, which so well deserves his
Majesty’s approbation.</p>

<p class="fs80 noindent">“Lieut.-Colonel Fearon, 31st Regt.”</p>
</div>

<p>His Majesty was graciously pleased to confer upon
Lieut.-Colonel Fearon the distinction of a Companion
of the Bath, for his conduct on the 1st of March.</p>

<p>On the 10th of April a detachment, from the head-quarters
at Chatham, marched to Gravesend, and embarked
on board the “Charles Grant,” under the
command of Lieut.-Colonel Cassidy, who had, a short
time before, been appointed to the regiment. After a
good passage the “Charles Grant” reached Calcutta
on the 16th of August, when the detachment was
ordered to Berhampore; it joined the left wing in that
cantonment on the 12th of September, when, immediately
on its landing, orders were received to return to
Fort William. On the 21st of the same month, the left
wing, with the detachment,&mdash;all under the command
of Lieut.-Colonel Cassidy,&mdash;were again embarked,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
and dropping down the river, in a few days reached
Fort William, and disembarking, marched into barracks
in the fort on the 27th of September.</p>

<p>On the 17th of November the head-quarters marched
into Fort William, and the regiment was once more
together. This portion had embarked on board the
“Lord Hungerford” on the 21st of June, under the
command of Major Eagar.</p>

<p>The cholera broke out among the men of the regiment
towards the end of November, and not abating,
the regiment moved into camp on the south glacis of the
fort. The ground was occupied on the 20th of December,
and the change was soon attended with advantage.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1826</div>

<p>On the 18th of January 1826, another detachment,
consisting of the grenadier company, and part of
No. 1, joined, and the strength of the regiment was
39 officers, 50 serjeants, 17 drummers, 48 corporals, and
812 privates.</p>

<p>On the 13th of February the regiment embarked on
the river Hoogley, and left the ghaut below the fort
for the Sunderbunds, on its route to Dinapore, the
Bhagaritty river, by which branch of the Ganges
it would have entered the main stream, being at this
season of the year too shallow for boats of such a size
as composed the fleet. The cholera unfortunately
made its appearance during the voyage, and carried off
a great number of men. The disease was so sudden
in its attacks, and so quick in its effects, that the men
scarcely survived till assistance could reach them from
the hospital, which being always in the rear, the boat
in which a sick man might be, was ordered to drop down
to it,&mdash;it therefore became necessary to supply officers
with a mixture to be given immediately to the person<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
seized: the sick man thus received aid from the nearest
boat to his own, and was saved until the more necessary
treatment could be used upon him. It was the 2nd of
May before the regiment reached Dinapore;&mdash;this cantonment
is within a few miles of Patna, midway between
it and the junction of the Soane with the Ganges; it
is composed of two quadrangles, a larger and a smaller
one, the southern side of the former being occupied by
two long buildings, with a road dividing them in the
centre; these formed the barracks, each for a wing of a
regiment, the remaining sides of the square being the
quarters of the officers;&mdash;the centre area is a smooth
greensward, used as a parade-ground; the river flows
on the north of the whole, and within a few yards of the
quarters on that side.</p>

<p>At the end of the hot season of the year, the regiment
was ordered to Meerut, and commenced its first march
in India, before daylight on the morning of the 8th of
November, under Lieut.-Colonel James Cassidy, who
had succeeded to the command of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>,
Lieut.-Colonel Fearon having been appointed to the
sixty-fourth regiment on the 12th of January, 1826.
The sick with the women and children had been previously
sent by water under Captain Bolton.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1827</div>

<p>The route of the regiment lay across the Soane, which
it passed at Quilwur Ghaut, through the Shahabad
district to Buxar, beneath the fort of which place it
crossed the Ganges by ferry, and marched towards the
military station of Ghazeepore, then occupied by the
forty-fourth regiment. After passing this post, the
regiment crossed the Goomtee by a bridge of boats,
where it falls into the Ganges, near the village of Kitee;
then to the cantonment of Seerole, near the city of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
Benares; again reached the banks of the Ganges, at the
little village of Joosey, and recrossed it to Allahabad;
thence the route lay through Kurrah, Futtehpore, and
Korah to Etawah, a city on the Jumna. From Etawah
through Shekohabad and Jellasir, in the province of
Agra; passing the dilapidated fort of Shasnee, the road
led through the city of Coel, to the celebrated fortress
of Allyghur; thence by Khorjah Bolundshuhur and
Haupper to Meerut, where the regiment arrived on the
morning of Saturday, January 13th, 1827, after a march
of sixty-seven days, during which time the men continued
very healthy;&mdash;the number in hospital never exceeded
thirty, many for trifling cases, and but two men died.</p>

<p>On the same day the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> occupied the lines
vacated by the fourteenth regiment. Meerut was the
head-quarters of a division of the Bengal Army, commanded
by Major-General Reynell; and a considerable
force was assembled, as a check upon Delhi, thirty-six
miles from Meerut, as well as upon the province of
Rohilcund, on the opposite shore of the Ganges.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> had been without colours since
the destruction of the “Kent,” but a new stand, which,
for want of an opportunity, had not yet been presented,
was in possession of the regiment; and the Governor-General
of India, the Right Honorable Lord Amherst,
being at Delhi, in the course of a tour of the upper
provinces, his Lady was solicited to present the new
colours to the regiment. They were presented by her
Ladyship on the 7th of March, 1827, and the Governor-General
addressed the following speech to Lieut.-Colonel
Cassidy on the occasion:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am persuaded that Lady Amherst will consider
herself fortunate in having been selected to bear so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
distinguished a part in the ceremony of this day. It
will be her earnest prayer that so dire a calamity as
that <ins class="corr" id="tn-96" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'which befel your'">
which befell your</ins> former colours may never occur
to these which she has had the honor to present to
you. From the ordinary perils of war they are safe
in your hands, and she confidently trusts that Her
Majesty’s <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> will ever march to victory
under the colours now consigned to your charge.”</p>
</div>

<p>To celebrate the event, the officers of the regiment
entertained a large party at a ball and supper in their
Mess-house.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1828</div>

<p>During the years 1828 and 1829 the regiment continued
at Meerut.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1829</div>

<p>In 1829 orders were received to reduce the establishment
of the regiment to 736 rank and file.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment was at this time stronger
than it had ever been; its effective strength amounted
to 1086. The men were young and in high health;
the climate good, and the barracks excellent, different
from those at Dinapore; they consisted of a certain
number of detached buildings, each calculated for a
subdivision only: they were thatched, and had at the
angles good rooms for non-commissioned officers. New
buildings were erected of even a superior description,
each company having four houses allotted to it, with its
proportion of non-commissioned officers’ rooms at the
angles, as in the old buildings.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1831</div>

<p>In the commencement of the year 1831 the north-west
frontier of India was reinforced, and the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>
marched to Kurnaul, the head-quarters of the
Sirhind division. The regiment left Meerut on the
27th of January, and halted that day at Sardhanna,
the capital of an independent state, under the celebrated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
Begum Sumroo. She had been its ruler for a
period of sixty years; and, a Mahometan in her youth,
she had adopted Christianity. The officers of the regiment
dined with her Highness.</p>

<p>It is five days’ march from Meerut to Kurnaul. On
the 30th of January the river Hinden was crossed by
ferry, and on the following day the river Jumna, when
the regiment encamped in its new quarters. The barracks
had not then been built, Kurnaul never having been
occupied by a British regiment. The Native
cantonment was situated in front of the city, facing to
the north.</p>

<p>The new lines marked out for the regiment were in
front of the right of the old lines facing the west, in
which quarter an extensive plain extends, without one
tree to shade it, as far as the eye can reach; in the
rear flows the canal of Merdan Ali Khan, a lively
stream drawn from the Jumna at Rajghaut, fifty miles
above, and running to Delhi, eighty miles below. On
the right are long tracts of jungle, with a few villages
and some cultivated land near the bank of the canal, a
little to the rear. The barracks were detached buildings,
two to each company.</p>

<p>General Sir Henry Warde, G.C.B., was appointed
from the sixty-eighth regiment to the Colonelcy of the
<span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment on the 13th of April, 1831, in
succession to General the Earl of Mulgrave, G.C.B.,
deceased.</p>

<p>It was the month of June before the barracks were
ready to receive the men, until which time the regiment
remained in camp. The officers’ houses in rear of the
barracks were built at their own expense, it being the
custom in the upper provinces of India to possess property<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
of this description; the inconvenience and expense
of establishing a cantonment are very severe
at the time on many, particularly on the junior officers.
It is only, however, when a cantonment is altogether
abandoned that this custom can be attended with loss.
Kurnaul was likely to be permanent from its position
with regard to the Punjaub and the dominions of the
Ameers of Scinde, besides the great importance acquired
every year by the country beyond the Indus.</p>

<p>In October, 1831, the regiment marched to Roopur
on the river Sutlej, as part of the escort attached to
the Governor-General, Lord William Bentinck, who
had arranged to have an interview at that place with
his Highness Runjeet Singh, the Ruler of the Punjaub.</p>

<p>Having left Kurnaul on the 10th of October, the
regiment reached the ground allotted for the escort on
the 22nd of that month; the route lay through the
Sikh territories, on the British side of the Sutlej.
Thennaiser, a spot of celebrated sanctity, and Umballa,
a populous city, were the only places of consequence,
however, on the march. The escort assembled at
Roopur, to do honor to the interview, was composed of
two squadrons of the sixteenth Lancers, with the band
of that regiment, the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment, two battalions
of native infantry (the 14th and 32nd), eight
guns of horse artillery, with two squadrons of irregular
cavalry from Colonel Skinner’s regiment.</p>

<p>The force Runjeet Singh had brought with him
encamped, on the morning of the 25th of October,
on the opposite bank of the river, and consisted of ten
thousand of his best horse and six thousand disciplined
infantry. A bridge of boats had been thrown
across the river, and on the morning of the 26th of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
October the meeting took place; the Chief of the
Punjaub, accompanied by a deputation of British
officers that had gone to meet him, with a detachment
of 3800 horse, 800 being disciplined dragoons, under
General Allard, a French officer in Runjeet’s service,
crossed the river. All the Sikh chiefs were in attendance
on their Sovereign, and the train passed through a
street to the Governor-General’s camp, formed by the
sixteenth Lancers and the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment.
This is not the place in which to dwell on the splendour
or chivalrous appearance of the scene, on the glitter of
the polished armour of some, and the gaiety of the
yellow silk in which all were dressed. The British
troops were infinitely greater objects of interest and
curiosity to the Sikhs, than even the variety of the
arms, and the figures of the men of the latter, were to
the former. Runjeet Singh inquired into every thing
connected with the arming and disciplining of the
<span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> with the keenest eye. During a review
of the corps, on a second visit, he rode close into the
line, and examined every movement, pointing out with
great intelligence to the Sirdars, or leaders, about him
the evolutions that he thought useful, or sending them
to observe particularly how they were performed.
The <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment was not under arms on the
return visit. The farewell interview took place on the
last day of the month, with the same ceremony as that
observed at the first meeting.</p>

<p>The next morning (November 1st) the camps broke
up; the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment returned, by the
route it had come, to Kurnaul, and arrived there on
the 16th of November.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1832</div>

<p>In the spring of the year 1832, Lieut.-Colonel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
Cassidy returned to England in ill health, after having
commanded the regiment seven years. He was
succeeded by Major Eagar, who died in December
following, when for nearly three years the command of
the regiment devolved upon the two senior Captains
alternately.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1834</div>

<p>On the 10th of October, 1834, Lieut.-General Sir
Edward Barnes, G.C.B., was appointed from the
seventy-eighth regiment to the Colonelcy of the
<span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment, in succession to General Sir
Henry Warde, G.C.B., deceased.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1835</div>

<p>In December, 1834, Major Bolton joined the regiment,
and was promoted, in November of the following
year, to the rank of Lieut.-Colonel, by purchase,
Colonel Cassidy having been removed to the charge of
a recruiting district.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1836</div>

<p>On the 20th of January, 1836, the regiment left
Kurnaul on its march to Dinapore, and, halting a day
near Delhi, crossed the Jumna below the city; thence,
continuing through the Doab (land between two
rivers), to Allahabad, crossed the Ganges by a bridge of
boats above the fort. Having halted at Benares and
Ghazeepore, it recrossed the Ganges at Buxar, and arriving
on the 26th of March at Dinapore, again took
up its quarters in the barracks it had occupied ten years
before;&mdash;although the weather was very hot, and the
regiment had marched without a day’s halt from Cawnpore
(thirty-one marches), there were only fifteen sick.
From Kurnaul to Dinapore the change of climate is
very great, while the confinement of the latter place,
with the close and crowded state of the barracks, after
the open scene, the comfortable thatched buildings, and
the cold bracing winter air of the former station, were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
severely felt. In Kurnaul the hospital list never exceeded
seventy, while it occasionally continued, during
the hot weather, so low as thirty, and in the cold season
eight or nine, for months together.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1837</div>

<p>During the summer of the year 1837, the thermometer
remained at 115 degrees in the barracks for
several days, and many deaths occurred from apoplexy,
produced by the great heat.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1838</div>

<p>Lieut.-General Sir Colin Halkett, K.C.B. and
G.C.H., was appointed from the seventy-first regiment
to the Colonelcy of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment, on the
28th of March, 1838, in succession to General Sir
Edward Barnes, G.C.B., deceased.</p>

<p>On the 16th of November the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> marched
towards Ghazeepore, to relieve the forty-fourth regiment,
and occupied the barracks at that station on the
27th of that month. Ghazeepore stands at the edge of
a fine plain on the left bank of the Ganges, close to the
river. It is one of the frontier posts towards Nepaul, is
forty-six miles from Benares, and four hundred and
six miles from Calcutta.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1839</div>

<p>The strength of the regiment had been reduced to
six hundred and thirty-two rank and file; it had at
this period been fourteen years in India, during which
time the casualties by death amounted to fourteen
officers, and six hundred and seventy-seven men.</p>

<p>During this year the regiment remained cantoned at
Ghazeepore, under the command of Lieut.-Colonel
Bolton; and was constantly on the alert in expectation
to march towards Nepaul to repel the incursions of the
Nepaulese.</p>

<p>On the 3rd of April, 1839, the regiment was augmented
to an establishment of ten companies, consisting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
of one colonel, two lieut.-colonels, two majors, ten
captains, thirty subalterns, six staff, fifty-seven serjeants,
nineteen drummers, and nine hundred and
seventy-six rank and file.</p>

<p>On the 13th of May, 1839, the regiment was inspected
by Major-General Cocks, of the Honorable East India
Company’s Service, who expressed, in high terms, his
approbation of its appearance.</p>

<p>Ghazeepore was found very unhealthy during the
rains, and the regiment suffered severely, both in officers
and men, from fever and dysentery.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1840</div>

<p>The regiment remained at Ghazeepore until the 12th
of October, 1840, when orders were received to march
to Agra, to relieve the ninth foot. It arrived at Agra
on the 30th of November, and its effectives amounted
to forty-one serjeants, and seven hundred rank and
file.</p>

<p>At Agra the regiment was more healthy than at the
two former stations, and its strength was increased
during the year by a large detachment of recruits from
England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1841</div>

<p>In March, 1841, a large party of recruits joined the
regiment under the command of Major Skinner, through
whose able management they arrived in the highest
possible order.</p>

<p>Owing to the indefatigable exertions of Lieut.-Colonel
Bolton, the commanding officer, little time elapsed
before the regiment formed a highly disciplined and
most efficient battalion of 992 bayonets.</p>

<p>At this period the government of Shah Shoojah
became so unpopular, that the Affghans appeared
determined to effect the expulsion of the British, by
whose aid he had been reinstated in the sovereignty of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
Cabool in 1839, and whose presence was rendered
necessary to support his authority.</p>

<p>Towards the close of the year 1841, the Affghans
broke out into open insurrection; the British Envoy, Sir
William McNaghten, and Sir Alexander Burnes were
treacherously murdered; and the British troops, including
the forty-fourth regiment, which occupied Cabool,
being compelled to evacuate and retreat towards Jellalabad,
were cut to pieces on the march.</p>

<p><em>Jellalabad</em> was soon beleaguered by the Affghans, and
every exertion was made to send succour from India to
its little garrison, commanded by Lieut.-Colonel Sir
Robert Sale, of the thirteenth light infantry, who was
serving with the rank of Major-General in Affghanistan.
Upon the breaking out of the insurrection, the Major-General
had been detached from Cabool with a force,
in order to reduce the insurgents, and, after much hard
fighting in the passes, had taken possession of Jellalabad,
the successful defence of which, by his small garrison,
forms so interesting a feature in the Affghan campaign.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1842</div>

<p>The regiment was ordered to join a force collected at
Peshawur, in the north of the Punjaub, under Major-General
Pollock; and on the 15th of January, 1842, it
marched from Agra, mustering 996 bayonets, in the
highest state of discipline and efficiency.</p>

<p>On the 10th of March the Sutlej was crossed by means
of a bridge of boats (which had been constructed for the
accommodation of the British troops by the Sikh
government) by the force under the command of Lieut.-Colonel
Bolton, of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment. The
force, which consisted of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment, the
sixth native infantry, some troops of Tait’s irregular
horse, and Delafosse’s troop of horse artillery, arrived<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
at Peshawur on the 21st of April, and was most hospitably
entertained by General Avitabile,<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> by order of
the Maharajah Shere Singh.</p>

<p>Before the corps could join the army, Major-General
Pollock forced the Khyber Pass, and marched on to
Jellalabad, at which place he arrived on the 16th of
April; the Affghans had, on the 7th of April, been
attacked, and defeated, by Major-General Sir Robert
Sale; Mahomed Akbar Khan was consequently obliged
to abandon the siege of Jellalabad, which he had
blockaded since February, 1842.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment, which had followed
Major-General Pollock by forced marches, joined at
Jellalabad on the 5th of May,&mdash;after making a halt for
about five days at Peshawur,&mdash;having undergone much
privation on the way by the desertion of the camel-drivers:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
several deaths occurred from famine and
fatigue.</p>

<p>The army was halted in wretched tents at Jellalabad,
the climate of which is known to be so unhealthy during
the summer as to cause it to be used by the natives as
a winter residence only. Soon the effects of this displayed
itself; the days became so oppressive that both
officers and men were obliged to dig deep holes underground
in which to shield themselves, in some slight
measure, from the burning heat of the sun. The
thermometer rose as high as 126° in the tents, and
man and beast fell stricken by the extreme heat.</p>

<p>Neither was it in men alone that the army was daily
losing its efficiency. From the valley of Jellalabad
having been so long the seat of war, the fertile land
had become a desert,&mdash;the wretched half-starved camels
could find no forage on the bare face of the sand, and they
died by hundreds; their dead bodies lying about in all
directions, swollen with the sun, and emitting the most
horrid exhalations, together with the filth and dirt of
a standing camp of 50,000 men, added to the disease
which raged among the troops. The army suffered a
loss which the most sanguinary encounter with the
enemy could not have exceeded.</p>

<p>At last, it was found necessary to divide the force,
and the fourth brigade, in which was the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>
regiment, was ordered to march under Brigadier Monteath
to Peshbolak, in the Shinwaree country, to punish
some refractory tribes, which had behaved with great
treachery to a party of Jezailchees, who had been at the
former place, and to bring to submission the unruly
Shinwarees, who had attacked several convoys, and
been guilty of many acts of murder and plunder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span></p>

<p>For the first month the regiment met with little
opposition, and the camel-thorn, a wild bush, on the
leaves of which camels feed, being found in great quantities,
and large supplies of grain being taken, the
condition of the camels, horses, and other baggage animals
was much improved; the half-starved emaciated
animals, which had marched from Jellalabad, quickly
recovered their wonted vigour and efficiency. The
warlike and turbulent Shinwaree tribes retired before
Brigadier Monteath’s brigade, until they sheltered
themselves in their strongholds, which were formed in a
narrow valley, strengthened by many forts and stockaded
enclosures, while the heights on either side were
defended by numerous <em>sunghas</em>, or breastworks of large
stones, which were so constructed as to enable them to
dispute every inch of ground with an advancing
force.</p>

<p>The brigade having arrived, and encamped about
two miles from this formidable position, a reconnoitring
party was sent out, under the command of
Captain Willes, of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment, to examine
the strength of the enemy’s preparations, and
determine his exact position. It was composed of two
companies of the thirty-third Native Infantry, with
a few Jezailchees, or Native Light Infantry, so named
from the Jezail, or short rifle, with which they are
armed. This party, having proceeded some four or
five miles from the camp, was furiously attacked by a
large force of Shinwarees, and suffered severely from
their fire, which was very effective from the position
they had taken up, and from which it required a very
considerable force to drive them: nevertheless the
object sought was fully obtained; the enemy’s position<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
was correctly ascertained, together with every requisite
information for the attack in force, after which the
reconnoitring party returned to the camp, sustaining
a smart action the whole way back.</p>

<p>On the 26th of July Brigadier Monteath prepared
to attack the enemy near <em>Mazeena</em> with his whole
force; and accordingly, leaving the camp standing under
an efficient guard, he moved towards the position occupied
by the Affghans, who were prepared, and nothing
loth to meet him. Little time elapsed before the
engagement was commenced by the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>
regiment, seconded by the thirty-third and fifty-third
Native Infantry, ascending the heights, and driving
the Shinwarees from their breastworks, and along
the ridges of the hills, while the tenth Light Cavalry,
in the valley below, charged them whenever they
showed front on level ground. The camp followers
and pioneers had been furnished with combustibles to
burn the forts, as the Shinwarees were driven out of
them, which service was very efficiently performed.
Meanwhile, on the heights, the enemy disputed every
foot of ground until taken at the point of the bayonet,
and Lieut. M‘Ilween, of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment,
was killed while gallantly leading an attack of this
kind against a vastly superior force.</p>

<p>The Affghans being driven from their defences, the
artillery, under the command of Captain Abbott,
played upon them with great effect; and after contesting
the day until every fort and place of defence had
been taken and destroyed, they fled, dispersing themselves
among the neighbouring hills, where it was impossible
to pursue them. Their loss was very great,
including most of their leaders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span></p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment had Lieut. Dalway
M‘Ilveen <em>killed</em>, and seven rank and file <em>wounded</em>;
several men of the regiment died suddenly from apoplexy,
caused by the heat of the sun and want of
water. Thus ended the action of Mazeena, in which
the behaviour of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment elicited
the highest commendation from Brigadier Monteath,
who stated, in his despatch of the 27th of July, that</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">“at one time the interiors of five-and-thirty forts were
in a blaze along the valley, the enemy contemplating
the scene from the heights in the vicinity of Secunder
Khan’s fort, where they had taken up positions, and
from whence they were driven in gallant style by the
advance, consisting of the light and two battalion
companies of Her Majesty’s <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment,
the light companies of the thirty-third and fifty-third
regiments of Native Infantry, and the corps of
Jezailchees under <em>Major Skinner</em>, of Her Majesty’s
<span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment.</p>

<p>“It gives me great pleasure to record the zealous
conduct of the troops generally, and the cheerful
and praiseworthy manner in which the soldiers of
Her Majesty’s <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment laboured to
drag the guns up such places as the horses, notwithstanding
their unequalled qualities, were incapable
of doing.</p>

<p>“My thanks are very justly due to <em>Lieut.-Colonel
Bolton</em>, of Her Majesty’s <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment, for
the able manner in which he conducted the duties of
covering the retirement of the force; and particularly
so to <em>Major Skinner</em> for the zealous and gallant
manner in which he led the advance against the
enemy.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span></p>

<p>The Brigadier also acknowledged the services of
other officers belonging to the force under his command,
in which number was included Lieutenant and
Adjutant Lugard, of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment, who
acted as Major of Brigade.</p>

<p>The brigade of Brigadier-General Monteath, having
thus performed most successfully the service for which
it had been detached, now marched to join the main
army at Jellalabad, and arriving there took up its old
ground. On the 22nd of August the army marched
in two divisions, and proceeded without opposition, but
suffering intense fatigue from the labour of dragging
the artillery and stores over the almost inaccessible
paths, until it arrived at Soorkhab, distant four marches
from Jellalabad.</p>

<p>On the British leaving Soorkhab, the Affghans showed
themselves in force, and the rear-guard, under the
command of Lieut.-Colonel Bolton, was so hard-pressed
by thousands of the irregular troops of the enemy, that
Brigadier Monteath thought it necessary to halt the
brigade at the entrance of the Jugdulluck pass, to
enable it to form a junction with the main column,
which it did after suffering considerable loss. The
Ghilzees hotly contested the passage of the pass, but
after a sharp engagement they were driven off with
much slaughter.</p>

<p>In this action Lieut.-Colonel Bolton had his horse
shot under him in two places, and Lieutenant Shaw,
of the regiment, was wounded.</p>

<p>The next day (9th September) the Affghans were so
much dispirited by their defeat, that the division
marched to Jugdulluck without further opposition
than a little skirmishing with the rear-guard, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
Lieutenant Brooke, of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment, was
wounded.</p>

<p>On the 10th of September, it having been ascertained
that Akbar Khan with 20,000 men had established
himself in the Khoord Cabool pass, in order to cover the
capital and fight a pitched battle with the British, the
second division was ordered to join the first by a forced
march to Tezeen, where Major-General Pollock was encamped.
This junction was effected on the 11th of September,
with little loss, although a running fight was
kept up the greater part of the way. In fact, the
advance to Cabool was a succession of skirmishes, oftentimes
by night as well as by day.</p>

<p>The camp was attacked on the night of the 12th of
September, but the enemy made no impression, and
little loss occurred, although all the piquets of the
<span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment were engaged until daybreak.</p>

<p>Shortly after daybreak on the 13th of September the
army moved off its ground towards the <em>Tezeen Pass</em>,
the advanced guard, commanded by Sir Robert Sale,
being composed of three companies of the ninth regiment,
three companies of the thirteenth or Prince
Albert’s Light Infantry, together with two companies
of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment, under Captain Baldwin
and Lieutenant Greenwood.</p>

<p>After moving carefully along the pass for about two
miles, the Affghans were discovered, in great force,
occupying strong positions on the heights on either
side, while their artillery and cavalry were formed some
distance farther on in the pass itself. The action
commenced by a heavy fire from the enemy on the
advanced guard of the British; and the distance being
too great for musketry, from the effect of which also<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
the Affghans were covered by extensive <em>sunghas</em>, or
intrenchments formed of large blocks of stone, for the
whole length of their position, it was judged necessary
for the troops to ascend the heights, and drive them
from their posts at the point of the bayonet.</p>

<p>This service was most brilliantly performed on the
left heights by the ninth and <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiments,
and on the right by the thirteenth light infantry.</p>

<p>The companies ascended the face of the mountain
under a most galling fire, from the effects of which
many casualties occurred, and not returning a shot
until the ledge was gained: a combined volley within
ten yards of the enemy, followed by an immediate
charge of bayonets, drove him from his defences with
great slaughter, and the heights were gained. For
this service Captain Baldwin received the brevet rank
of Major.</p>

<p>The Affghans’ advanced posts being driven in and
pursued as far as the broken and difficult nature of the
country would admit, they retired upon their supports,
which were, with great judgment, defended by
endless <em>sunghas</em>, erected in every position from which a
fire could be brought on advancing troops.</p>

<p>The British, having gained the heights, and being
reinforced by fresh troops, pushed on, and, storming
one intrenchment after another, threw the Affghans
into great confusion. The artillery, having been
brought up, played upon them with terrific effect,
while the British cavalry, having charged and overthrown
their horse, posted in the pass, and taken
their guns, together with the state tent of Akbar
Khan, the fortune of the day at this early period evidently
smiled on the British arms; but the warlike<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
mountaineers, who composed the Affghan army, fought
with desperate valour to retrieve the day. Attack
after attack was made upon the troops occupying the
posts from which the enemy had first been driven. Reckless
of life, the stern fanatics came on to be shot down
from the defences which they had themselves thrown
up. In a series of desultory attacks the day declined,
and the British, having obtained possession of every
height commanding the pass, the remains of the
Affghan army made a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">détour</i> among the hills, falling
with great fury upon the British rear-guard, commanded
by Colonel Richmond, of the thirty-third
regiment of Native Infantry. Here they were so
warmly received that their discomfiture was completed,
and the day was won. The victorious British encamped
for the night in the valley of Khoord (Little) Cabool,
a village distant about sixteen miles from Cabool.</p>

<p>In this action Lieutenant Pollard received a severe
contusion from a large block of stone while attempting
to take a standard. Major Skinner, of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>
regiment, highly distinguished himself with the
force which was detached under his command, and
which proceeded, in the afternoon of the 12th of September,
across the hills towards the valley of Khoord
Cabool by a route different from that of the main
army. On the march, Major Skinner came suddenly in
presence of a greatly superior number of Affghans.
Notwithstanding that the country was difficult and
imperfectly known, by a series of skilful manœuvres
he extricated his troops from the perilous situation in
which they were placed, and defeated the Affghans,
who exceeded five times his force, with great slaughter,
on the 13th of September.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span></p>

<p>So complete was the defeat of the Affghan army on
the 13th of September, that Akbar Khan escaped from
the field accompanied only by a solitary horseman.</p>

<p>The enemy acknowledged to have lost fifty-three
chiefs and persons of consequence, and 700 men. The
casualties on the part of the British amounted to 185.</p>

<p>Major-General Pollock, in his despatch dated 14th of
September, again acknowledged the services of Lieut.-Colonel
Bolton and Major Skinner, of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>
regiment.</p>

<p>No impediments now existed to the advance of the
British on the city of Cabool. On the 15th of September
the army arrived at Cabool, and encamped on the
race-course. On the following day the place was occupied
and the standard of England hoisted on the
highest pinnacle of the battlements of the Bala Hissar
(Upper Fort), on which occasion the flank companies
of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> formed part of the guard which
garrisoned the citadel. The British colours were hoisted
daily as long as the army remained at Cabool.</p>

<p>All the objects of the campaign having been gained,
and the rescue of the prisoners effected,&mdash;among whom
were several officers and ladies (Lady Sale, the partner
of the gallant defender of Jellalabad being among the
number), also three serjeants, three drummers, and
thirty rank and file of Her Majesty’s forty-fourth
regiment,&mdash;the Anglo-Indian army commenced its
march towards Hindoostan on the 12th of October,
after having destroyed the grand bazaar of Cabool,
named the Chahar Chuttah, where the remains of the
British Envoy had been exposed to public insult by
the infuriated Affghans.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment was again constantly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
engaged in desultory skirmishes with the Ghilzees
and Afreedee tribes which infested the passes.</p>

<p>At the <em>Jugdulluck Pass</em> the Affghans again made
head, and a severe action occurred on the 18th of
October, in which the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment sustained
some loss, but the Ghilzees were put to flight with
great slaughter. Lieutenant Thomas Pender, of the
<span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment, received a severe wound near
Seh Baba, from the effects of which he died on the
18th of November.</p>

<p>Major-General McCaskill, in his despatch dated
20th of October, 1842, recording the attacks on his
division by the predatory tribes of the mountains
between Tezeen and Gundamuck, stated that,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Throughout these affairs the conduct of the troops
employed, including the second and sixteenth Native
infantry, temporarily attached to me, has deserved
my highest approbation, and I feel it to be my duty
to record, that in the advance to Cabool, and in retiring
from it, the bravery of that portion of the fourth
brigade which took part in the active operations,
namely, Her Majesty’s <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment, and
a wing of the thirty-third Native infantry,&mdash;the remaining
wing and the sixth Native infantry having
been detained to garrison Jellalabad and Gundamuck,&mdash;as
well as their endurance of privations and
fatigue, have been beyond all praise. No troops
could, in every respect, have behaved better; and I
feel myself to be deeply indebted to Brigadier
Monteath, C.B., and to Lieut.-Colonel Bolton, of
Her Majesty’s <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>, and to Lieut.-Colonel
Richmond, of the thirty-third Native infantry, for the
able and gallant manner in which they have been led.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span></p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment arrived at Jellalabad
on the 23rd of October, and, after destroying the fortifications,
proceeded thence on the 27th to Peshawur,
where it arrived in the beginning of November.</p>

<p>The campaign having now been brought to a close,
the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> reached Ferozepore on the 19th of
December, having been in the field for eleven months
during this arduous campaign.</p>

<p>On arrival at Ferozepore the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment
joined the “Army of Reserve,” which had been assembled
on the frontier, and where the Governor-General,
Lord Ellenborough, and General Sir Jasper
Nicolls, the commander-in-chief in India, had proceeded
to receive the army of Affghanistan.</p>

<p>For his services connected with the command of the
<span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment, Lieut.-Colonel Bolton was
made a Companion of the Bath, and appointed aide-de-camp
to the Queen, with the rank of colonel.</p>

<p>In testimony of the services of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>
during the campaign in Affghanistan, Her Majesty
was graciously pleased to authorize the regiment to
bear the word “<span class="smcap">Cabool, 1842</span>,” on the regimental
colour and appointments.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1843</div>

<p>On the breaking up of the army at Ferozepore, the
<span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>, commanded by Colonel Bolton, was
ordered to Umballa, a place about 170 miles to the
south, and which had never been previously occupied
by troops. Here the regiment arrived on the 27th of
January, 1843, and, cantonments having been marked
out, barracks were commenced for the men, and ground
allotted for the erection of bungalows for the officers.</p>

<p>On the 5th of May the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> sustained a
severe loss by the death of Major and Brevet Lieut.-Colonel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
Skinner, a zealous and talented officer, whose
services are frequently alluded to in the historical
record of the regiment.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>In May, 1843, the regiment was ordered to Khytul,
and formed part of a force under Major-General Fast,
which was sent to reduce the city and state of Khytul
to British subjection. The force arrived at Khytul
after about a week’s march, and the enemy, after a
slight show of resistance, evacuated the city, which was
occupied by the British troops. All the objects of the
expedition having been fulfilled, the regiment returned
to its cantonments at Umballa. All, however, remained
under canvas, exposed to most intense heat,
until July, 1843, when the men were housed, and a
few of the officers got shelter. In October, 1843, an
outbreak occurred at Lahore, and the Maharajah, Shere
Singh, was shot at a review by his brother-in-law, Ajeet
Singh; after this event the youthful Dhuleep Singh, a
reputed son of the late Runjeet Singh, was placed on
the throne.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment was in consequence
ordered to the frontier, and marched for Ferozepore on
the 16th of November, where it arrived on the 1st of
December, 1843, and remained as a corps of observation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1844</div>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>, commanded by Colonel Bolton,
C.B., continued at Ferozepore, where the regiment was
joined by ninety-three recruits from England. On the
16th of January, 1844, the regiment was inspected, and
elicited great praise from Major-General Hunter of the
Company’s Service, and again on the 16th of February,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
by Major-General Sir Robert Dick, K.C.B., who expressed
great praise as well of the soldierlike and
gallant bearing as of the high state of discipline of the
regiment.</p>

<p>The weather becoming extremely hot, the regiment
marched from Ferozepore on the 19th of April, 1844,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i> to Umballa, where it arrived on the 2nd of May.</p>

<p>On the 30th of December, 1844, his Excellency
General Sir Hugh Gough, Bart., Commander-in-Chief
in India, inspected the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>, in review order,
on which occasion he expressed himself highly satisfied
with the soldierlike appearance of the regiment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1845</div>

<p>On the 12th of March, 1845, a detachment of recruits
and volunteers, consisting of one major, one captain,
three lieutenants, two ensigns, one assistant-surgeon,
with four hundred and seventy-one rank and file, joined
the regiment from the lower provinces, under the command
of Major Spence.</p>

<p>Many men continued to die from the effects of the
Cabool campaign, but the station in itself proved
healthy until July, when it was visited by cholera in a
most fearful manner. On the 26th of July the regiment
was ordered into camp, about two miles from the
barracks, at a few hours’ notice, with orders for one
officer per company, as well as the medical officers,
constantly to remain in camp under Major Spence,
where they continued until the 5th of August. In one
month the regiment lost by cholera eighty-nine men,
women, and children.</p>

<p>After the death of Maha Shere Singh, the Punjaub
was in a state of anarchy; the juvenile sovereign,
Dhuleep Singh, under the tutelage of his mother and
uncle, was unable to control the turbulent Sikh chieftains,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
and open hostility soon manifested itself against
the British Government in India.</p>

<p>In the beginning of December, 1845, the inclination
of the Sikh Sirdars to invade the British territories
appeared to increase, and about the 11th of that
month, with a large army and a well-appointed artillery,
they actually crossed the Sutlej, the boundary
river which separates the Punjaub from the British
dominions.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>The Commander-in-Chief in India, General Sir
Hugh Gough, sent immediate orders for the Umballa
division of the army, which had lately been considerably
increased in strength, to be pushed on
towards the invaded frontier.</p>

<p>Previous to its march, this force had been formed
into divisions and brigades. The first brigade of the
first division was composed of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment,
and two regiments of Native infantry, viz., the
twenty-fourth and forty-seventh regiments. The first
division was commanded by Major-General Sir Henry
Smith; Colonel Bolton, C.B., of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>
regiment, was appointed Brigadier to command the
first brigade. Lieut.-Colonel Byrne, the next senior
officer, assumed the command of the regiment. Captain
Garvock was appointed Brigade-Major to the first
brigade, and Captain Lugard, Assistant-Adjutant-General
to the first division.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span></p>

<p>It being of the utmost importance to aid the division
of the army in the defence of Ferozepore, a fort
on the left bank of the Sutlej, where the British
Government had large magazines containing munitions
of war, a park of artillery, military stores, and
equipments for the field army, which protected the
frontier, it was necessary to push on the Umballa
division, with all possible speed, by rapid and forced
marches, towards the point near which the Sikhs, after
having crossed the Sutlej, were assembled in large force,
emboldened by numbers, and their army composed of
well-disciplined troops, with a numerous and well-appointed
artillery. This army had been instructed
and trained in European tactics and discipline by
French and Italian officers; it was confident in its
own strength and in the powerful aid of its formidable
artillery.</p>

<p>It was evidently the object of the enemy to prevent
the junction of the Umballa division with the Ferozepore
field force, to cut off the latter division, and
to capture the fort and magazines of Ferozepore,
before the Umballa division could arrive at the scene
of action. The enemy hoped also to have a rich booty
in the plunder of the large town of Ferozepore. The
Sikhs knew and calculated the distance the Umballa
troops had to march before they could reach the vicinity
of Ferozepore, one hundred and fifty miles, and the
nature of the country through which they had to
march; but they did not calculate on the energy,
patient endurance of hardships, and privation, which
the British soldier would cheerfully undergo, when he
knew, that his brave and heroic Commander-in-Chief
was leading him in person against the foe, who had
dared to invade the British possessions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span></p>

<p>On the 10th of December the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> received
the order to march, and the morning of the 12th saw
the regiment leave Umballa, mustering 30 officers and
844 men.</p>

<p>After long and harassing marches of twenty-five
to thirty miles a day, the severe nature of which it is
impossible to describe, the regiment arrived at the
village of <em>Moodkee</em> about two o’clock in the afternoon
of the 18th of December, having on that day performed
a march of not less than twenty-five miles: some idea
may be formed of the sufferings which the men
endured from fatigue on this eventful day, when it is
known that at the last halt, about two miles from
Moodkee, scarcely <em>fifty</em> men were left with the colours;
and for miles to the rear they might be seen staggering
forward through the soft sand in an exhausted state
from want of water and rest.</p>

<p>The soldiers were in the act of pitching their tents,
and had eaten nothing, when the alarm was given that
the enemy was close upon them in force. The <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>
rushed to arms, and forming the right of the
first brigade of the first division, under Major-General
Sir Henry Smith, formed in quarter-distance column,
left in front, advanced two or three miles, deployed
on the grenadier company, and so continued the line
formed by the regiments on their right.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> were now on ploughed land in
front of a thick jungle of thorny bushes, and moving
forward under a heavy fire of round and grape-shot,
entered the jungle, through which it was impossible to
move in anything like a correct line, and beyond which
the Sikhs were formed. It was here that the gallant
Colonel Bolton received his death-wound;&mdash;his last
emphatic words to the men were, “<em>Steady</em>, <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
<em>and fire low</em>,”&mdash;when man and horse came down together;
but he did not allow himself to be removed
from the field until the action was over. The regiment
now found itself in front of a battery of fourteen
or fifteen guns. By this time the men were falling
quickly under severe discharges of grape from the
guns, a few yards only distant, which were also protected
by a battalion of infantry, from which withering
volleys were sent into the ranks of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>,
who, however, returned it with interest, and the intrepid
valour of the men bore down all opposition.
One continued fire from the regiment laid low nearly
the whole of the enemy’s artillery-men opposed to its
part of the line, while the bayonet disposed of such of
the remainder of the foe as had not time to save themselves
by flight. The opposition of the Sikhs was
desperate; but nothing could resist the bravery of the
British troops, who drove them from one position after
another with great slaughter: all their advanced guns
remained in the hands of the British.</p>

<p>It was not till an hour and a half after sunset that
this hand to hand conflict was over, when the rolling of
musketry gradually died away, and the British found
themselves undisputed masters of the field. Soon
after the commencement of the action, Lieut.-Colonel
Byrne being severely wounded, the command of the regiment
devolved upon Major Spence, the senior major.</p>

<p>The regiment, being much broken and scattered over
the field in pursuit of the enemy, was re-formed in
quarter-distance column, and marched back to within
about a mile of Moodkee, where it bivouacked on the
sand until daylight, and then returned to camp.</p>

<p>In this short but hard-fought action the regiment
suffered severely. Of 30 officers and 814 men, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
went into action, 9 officers and 155 rank and file were
killed or wounded.</p>

<p>In this action Lieutenant Bolton, of the twenty-first
Fusiliers, acted as aide-de-camp to his father Brigadier
Bolton.</p>

<p>The army was commanded in the action by General
Sir Hugh Gough, the Commander-in-Chief, aided by
the counsel and military experience of the Governor-General,
Sir Henry Hardinge. The following extract
is taken from the despatch of the Commander-in-Chief,
dated 19th of December, 1845:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The opposition of the enemy was such as might
have been expected from troops who had everything
at stake, and who had long vaunted of being
irresistible. Their ample and extended line, from their
great superiority of numbers, far out-flanked ours;
but this was counteracted by the flank movements
of our cavalry. The attack of the infantry now
commenced; and the roll of fire from this powerful
arm soon convinced the Sikh army that they had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
met with a foe they little expected; and their whole
force was driven from position after position with
great slaughter, and the loss of seventeen pieces of
artillery, some of them of heavy calibre; our infantry
using that never-failing weapon, the bayonet,
whenever the enemy stood. Night only saved them
from worse disaster, for this stout conflict was
maintained during an hour and a half of dim starlight,
amidst a cloud of dust from the sandy plain, which
yet more obscured every object.</p>

<p>“I regret to say, this gallant and successful attack
was attended with considerable loss. The force
bivouacked upon the field for some hours, and only
returned to its encampment after ascertaining that it
had no enemy before it, and that night prevented the
possibility of a regular advance in <span class="nowrap">pursuit. * * *</span></p>

<p>“I have every reason to be proud of, and gratified
with, the exertions of the whole of the officers and
troops of this army on this arduous occasion.”</p>
</div>

<p>It appears from the list of killed and wounded, that
the first or Major-General Sir Henry Smith’s division
bore the brunt of the action at Moodkee, as the casualties
in that division out-numbered those of the other
two infantry divisions united, as will be seen by the
following published list:&mdash;</p>

<p>The army of the Sikhs amounted, it is said, to
upwards of 32,000 men of all arms. The British
force did not amount to more than one-third of that
number.</p>

<p>Thus terminated the battle of <em>Moodkee</em>, the first
action in which the Sikhs measured their strength
with British troops in the field.</p>

<p>The following extracts are taken from an account of
the battle of Moodkee:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Between the 11th and 18th the army had marched
over a distance of 160 miles, along roads of heavy
sand; the incessant toil scarcely leaving them leisure
to cook their food. Hardly an hour of repose was
allowed them when they were summoned to renewed
exertion. On the 18th the army took up their encamping
ground in front of Moodkee. Our troops
had scarcely time to prepare their food, when intelligence
was brought that the enemy, 30,000 strong,
was close at hand. It was about three o’clock <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>;
the men were tired with incessant work, suffering
from scarcity of water, and exhausted for want of
nourishment and rest. The instant the order was
given, however, they turned out with the utmost
alacrity, as if fresh from their lines.”</p>
</div>

<p>After describing the preliminary movements of the
cavalry and artillery, the narrator proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The afternoon was by this time far spent, and the
evening at hand. The infantry, under Generals<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
Smith, Gilbert, and McCaskill, pushed on in echellon
right for the enemy’s line, now nearly invisible from
the wood and approaching darkness. We were out-flanked
and fearfully out-numbered. The struggle
was tremendous. The Sikhs fought with the fury
of desperate men. Nothing could resist the dauntless
courage of our troops, and fearful was the storm
of musketry poured forth by them as they rushed.
The bayonet,&mdash;the never-failing resource of British
soldiers,&mdash;completed the confusion and havoc the
musketry had begun. Every position was forced; the
enemy driven from the ground they had so well
selected, and for a time so obstinately maintained;
and night found eighteen pieces of artillery in our
possession. Darkness only saved them from extreme
disaster; and so fierce and unrelenting had been the
fray, that it was maintained through an hour of dim
starlight, while the dust of the sandy plain added to
the obscurity of the advancing night. Pursuit was
impossible, and the troops bivouacked on the field.”</p>

<p>It being expected that the Sikhs, notwithstanding
their defeat on the previous evening, would make a
second attack, the troops were ordered under arms
early on the following morning, the 19th, and remained
so till evening, when, no enemy appearing, they
returned to their tents.</p>

<p>It having been subsequently ascertained, by scouts,
that the enemy was strongly entrenched in great
numbers round the village of Ferozeshah, the Commander-in-Chief
determined to effect a junction with
the troops at Ferozepore, and with the combined force
to drive the Sikhs from their position. Accordingly at
daylight on the 21st of December the army was formed
in separate columns of attack, and marched in order of
battle in the supposed direction of the enemy. Having
proceeded about five miles, it was ascertained that the
Sikhs had retired to their entrenched camp at <em>Ferozeshah</em>,
about twelve miles from Moodkee.</p>

<p>The troops then fell into columns of route, and after
a very fatiguing and circuitous march, rendered more
so from no water being procurable on the road, they
arrived about three o’clock <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> in the neighbourhood
of the enemy’s position, having, on the march, effected
the desired junction with the division under Major-General
Sir John Littler, consisting of five thousand
men and twenty-one guns, which had moved from
Ferozepore on the morning of the 21st of December:
about a quarter of an hour was allowed for rest, and
the plan of battle was then immediately arranged.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
The first division formed the reserve, and was drawn
up in line, the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> being about the centre:
here they remained about twenty minutes, during
which time the round shot were passing through the
ranks, killing and wounding several men.</p>

<p>The order was now given to advance to the support
of the troops, who were hotly engaged and hard-pressed;
the reserve moved forward in excellent order, though
darkness was coming on, and very shortly became
engaged and exposed to a heavy fire. The two lines
were shortly reduced to one, the shattered remains of
the reserve scarcely filling up the gaps formed in the
first line by the deadly fire of the enemy, who nobly
fought, and fell every man in his place; thus those <em>two</em>
lines, which had so shortly before presented the regularity
of a field-day, were now but <em>one</em>, standing surrounded
by their dead and dying comrades, and the
brave fellows of other European regiments could
scarcely understand how they came to be fighting in the
ranks of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>. After a long and desperate
contest, the Sikhs were driven from their guns,
but not without severe loss on the part of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>
regiment, both in officers and men. Lieut. and
Adjutant Bernard was killed on the spot, and Major
Baldwin and Lieut. Pollard were mortally wounded;
Lieut. Pilkington was struck by two shots, one passing
through each ankle; and the horse of Major Spence
was shot under him. On the death of Lieutenant and
Adjutant Bernard, Lieutenant Robertson was appointed
Adjutant, which appointment he held until the nomination
of Lieutenant Bolton was received from the
Horse Guards, he having been applied for by his father,
Colonel Bolton, previously to the campaign. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
camp of the Sikhs being now on fire in several places,
mines and magazines exploding with terrific violence at
short intervals, the enemy’s fire being silenced,&mdash;and
their guns standing undefended,&mdash;the order was given to
fall back a short distance and re-form, which was accordingly
done; the troops bivouacked during the night in
front of the Sikh camp, within reach of shot from their
guns, which, having been left unspiked, were quickly
reopened upon the exhausted troops, whose sufferings
on that fearful night, from thirst and intense cold, will
never be forgotten by those who endured them.</p>

<p>Towards morning the troops were formed in one
line facing the enemy; the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> happened
to be on the right of the whole. At the break of
day, the British artillery opened on the enemy, who
returned their fire, and after a short cannonading the
infantry advanced to the attack: the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>
moved steadily towards a battery of seven guns on
the enemy’s extreme left, which kept up a continued
fire of grape; it was, however, carried by the bayonet
without a single check, and almost without a shot
being fired by the assailants, though the loss of
the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> was severe. Having killed all the
enemy’s artillery-men who remained at their guns,
the regiment, led by its brave commander, Major
Spence, passed through the battery, and advanced
steadily in an excellent line for about 300 yards, when
it halted. The Governor-General and the Commander-in-Chief
passed down the ranks amidst the
cheers of the men; the line saluted them, dropping the
regimental colours; and private William Ash, a grenadier,
stood in front of his company displaying a colour
taken from the enemy in the battery before mentioned.</p>

<p>The defeat of the enemy now appearing to be
complete, the soldiers were allowed to go in search of
water, the want of which was severely felt. In the
course of half an hour the alarm was suddenly given,
that the Sikhs were coming down in force; the troops
were quickly placed in position, though there could be
no regularity as regarded brigades, and on the near approach
of the enemy’s horse, the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> formed
square, the Governor-General and his Staff placing
themselves in the centre: a terrific fire was now opened
upon the devoted troops (whose artillery ammunition
was expended) from the guns of Tej-Singh’s army
advancing to the support of the already defeated Sikhs,
and the tide of victory appeared about to turn, when
Sir Henry Hardinge, glancing at the small but undismayed
band around him, exclaimed “<span class="smcap">Thirty-first</span>,
remember <em>Albuhera</em>.” Line was, however, soon
after re-formed, no decided attack being made by
the enemy, who nevertheless kept up a galling and
destructive fire from his guns. The <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>
suffered very considerably without the power of
retaliation, but patiently maintained their position;
at one time, when threatened by cavalry, forming
an oblong square of four deep, one side of the square
being composed of the twenty-ninth foot under Brigadier
Taylor of that corps, the twenty-ninth forming
four deep to the front, and the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> four deep
to the rear, and in this position they remained for some
time, ready to receive cavalry. The <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>
maintained their position upwards of three hours, when
they were once more enabled to go in search of water by
the sudden and precipitate retreat of the enemy. The
water in the wells was, however, found to be in such a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
putrid state, as to be nearly useless, from the bodies of
the dead having been thrown into them; and the ground
in the neighbourhood was extremely dangerous, having
been extensively mined.</p>

<p>The loss of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment at the battle
of <em>Ferozeshah</em>, on the 21st and 22nd of December,
amounted to two officers killed and six wounded.</p>

<p>Captain Garvock, Major of Brigade, had his horse
shot under him in the advance to charge the enemy’s
batteries.</p>

<p>On the 21st of December, Lieutenant Bolton was
appointed to carry orders from the Governor-General
to Major-General Sir Henry Smith, and was transferred
from the twenty-first Fusiliers to the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>
regiment, to which he was appointed adjutant
shortly afterwards.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Pollard, a promising officer, was wounded
at Moodkee; but being a high-spirited young man,
he would not remain behind, when his regiment went
into action at Ferozeshah, although suffering from
his wound, and advised to remain in his tent by the
medical officers. He went into action on horseback;
his wound being in the foot, he was unable to walk.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
At the desire of Sir Henry Smith he was employed as
second adjutant to convey the orders of his commanding
officer, Major Spence, who was so hoarse from a
severe cold which he had caught at the battle of
Moodkee, that he could not make himself sufficiently
heard by the men; in the performance of this duty this
gallant young officer nobly fell.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The field after the retreat of the enemy was literally
covered with dead,&mdash;they had abandoned large
stores of grain, military stores, camp-equipage, and
ammunition. The loss of the British army was very
heavy; being opposed to a highly disciplined and
organized army more than treble their number, with
a field of artillery of battering calibre, admirably
served, which kept up an incessant and destructive
fire on the British troops: justifying the remark of
an officer, who had been in all Napoleon’s great battles,
that he never saw such devastation committed by
artillery at any battle in Europe. What other army
in the world would, under such circumstances, have,
within thirty hours, stormed an entrenched camp,
fought a general action, and sustained two considerable
combats with the enemy? Within four days it
dislodged from their positions 60,000 Sikh soldiers
supported by 150 pieces of artillery, 108 of which
the enemy acknowledged to have lost, and 91 of
which fell into our hands.”</p>
</div>

<p>Another account of <ins class="corr" id="tn-131" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text did not have a paragraph break here.">
the action states:&mdash;</ins></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The right wing was commanded by the Commander-in-Chief in
person; the left by the Governor-General. As our
troops deployed into line, and prepared for an
advance, a tremendous fire from upwards of one
hundred pieces of artillery, 40 of them of battering<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
size, was opened by the enemy. The right wing,
under Sir Hugh Gough, threw themselves with matchless
gallantry on the guns, and wrested them from the
enemy, when the storm of shot from the Sikh infantry
behind became so fearful, that a portion only of the
intrenchments could be carried, when darkness put
an end to the conflict.</p>

<p>“Night had now closed in; the carnage had proved
tremendous; our men thinned in numbers, harassed
with forced marches, exhausted with fatigue, with
little food and scarcely any water, and nothing whatever
to cover them from the chill and heavy dew as
the evening advanced, bivouacked amidst the dying
and the dead, close under the intrenchments, and
within reach of the shot of the enemy. All night long
their artillery played upon us, and as the waning moon
showed them our position, the cannon-shot ploughed
up the ground right through, and amidst the wearied
soldiers.</p>

<p>“Morning at length approached, and our troops were
once more arrayed for the fight. With daylight came
retribution and triumph to our arms. Our infantry
was formed in line, supported on both flanks by the
horse artillery. A masked battery now began to play
on us with fearful effect; the heavy shot of the Sikhs
dismounted our guns; nine of our tumbrils were blown
up. A general charge was now determined on; amidst
a terrific storm of shot and shell, the troops rushed on
undismayed; the carnage was fearful: battery after
battery was carried at the bayonet’s point; the camp
was pierced with loaded mines, which exploded with
fearful slaughter as we advanced. The village of
<em>Ferozeshah</em> was stormed, and the enemy driven out of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
it at every point. When changing its front to the left,
our force continued to sweep the camp, carrying everything
before them.</p>

<p>“Undisturbed and unbroken by the fearful service in
which they had been engaged, the troops drew up, when
the camp was won, and halted to cheer their generals
on the field they had just conquered, with the regularity
of a parade. Seventy-three guns had now been taken;
20 more quickly fell into our hands. We had lost 37
European and 17 Native officers, with 630 non-commissioned
officers and rank and file,&mdash;nearly 700 in all
killed. Our casualties in killed and wounded
amounted to 2415.”</p>
</div>

<p>The Commander-in-Chief in his despatch to the
Governor-General, after the battle of <em>Ferozeshah</em>, bears
the following testimony of his approbation of the gallant
conduct of the army under his command on that glorious
occasion. At the conclusion of the despatch General
Sir Hugh Gough stated:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“On the conclusion of such a narrative as I have
given, it is surely superfluous in me to say, that I am,
and shall be, to the last moment of my existence, proud
of the army which I had the honor to command on the
21st and 22nd instant. To its gallant exertions I owe
the satisfaction of seeing such a victory achieved, and
the glory of having my own name associated with it.”</p>
</div>

<p>On receipt in London of the despatch of the Governor-General
of India, announcing the victories of <em>Moodkee</em>
and <em>Ferozeshah</em>, the thanks of both Houses of Parliament
were voted unanimously to the Governor-General, the
Right Honorable Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Hardinge,&mdash;to
General Sir Hugh Gough, Bart., the Commander-in-Chief,&mdash;and
to the several officers under their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
command,&mdash;for the eminent services rendered by them
in the recent arduous and successful operations;&mdash;also
to the non-commissioned officers and soldiers, European
and Native, for the perseverance and fortitude maintained
by them at <em>Moodkee</em> on the 18th of December,
1845, and for the daring valour with which they forced
the enemy’s intrenchments at <em>Ferozeshah</em> on the 21st
and 22nd of December, captured most of his guns, and
finally compelled the Sikh army, of greatly superior
numbers, to retire within their own frontiers.</p>

<p>The thanks of the Court of East India Directors
were voted to the army of the Sutlej at the same time.</p>

<p>The Court of East India Directors confirmed the
grant of a medal to all the officers and soldiers engaged
in the battles of <em>Moodkee</em> and <em>Ferozeshah</em>, denoting that
they served in this important campaign.</p>

<p>On the 21st, 22nd, and 23rd of December, the army
bivouacked on the field of battle, having been, since
the morning of the 20th, without tents, or any regular
supply of food; and owing to the extreme heat by day,
and intense cold by night, both officers and men had
suffered much. On the 24th the troops changed their
ground about four miles to Sultan Khan Walla, and
three days afterwards the regimental baggage arrived.</p>

<p>At Sultan Khan Walla they remained seven days;
the whole army was then moved to the banks of the
Sutlej, not far from the fort of Hurreekee, where large
camps were formed. For nearly a week after these
terrible encounters, the Sikhs remained on the British
side of the Sutlej, the army being unable to follow up
its victory, as the troops, which were on their march to
join, had not yet arrived; the heavy artillery, which
was on the march from Cawnpore, was still very distant,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
and until the whole of the army was concentrated, it
would be impossible to attack the enemy, who had again
collected a formidable force of 70,000 men, with 110
pieces of ordnance, which were encamped on the opposite
side of the river, and ready to oppose the British.</p>

<p>In the meantime the wounded officers and soldiers
had been removed to the hospital at Ferozepore.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel Byrne being prevented from resuming
the command of the regiment by the severe
wound he received at Moodkee, Major Spence continued
to exercise the command during the arduous conflict
of the 21st and 22nd of December at Ferozeshah,
where he showed an example of bravery to his distinguished
regiment. He was ably supported by
every Officer and Man under his command. All nobly
performed their duty on this well-contested field.</p>

<p>Colonel Bolton, being mortally wounded at Moodkee,
died on the 4th January, 1846;<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> and the Commander-in-Chief
promoted Major Spence, the senior major,
to the Lieutenant-Colonelcy of the regiment.</p>

<p>Major Baldwin also died of the wounds received at
Ferozeshah.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Captains Bulkeley and Young were
promoted to the vacant majorities, a promotion which
they justly merited for their gallant conduct at Moodkee,
where both these officers were severely wounded.</p>

<p>Captain Willes, a meritorious and deserving officer,
also died of the wounds received at Moodkee. The
<span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment, now greatly reduced in numbers
from the heavy loss, both of officers and men, sustained
in the late arduous conflicts, still preserved its spirit and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
energy, and was ready at a moment’s notice to be led
on to future victories.</p>

<p>On the 30th of December, the Governor-General
published a General Order, congratulating the Army on
the recent victories, from which the following are extracts:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Governor-General again cordially congratulates
His Excellency Sir Hugh Gough, G.C.B., on
the great and important victories obtained by the
army under his command.</p>

<p>“The Governor-General, in the name of the government
and of the people of India, gratefully acknowledges
the noble services rendered to the public by
His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief, by all the
General and other Officers, and by the Non-Commissioned
Officers and Soldiers of the brave Indian
army.</p>

<p>“The Governor-General’s thanks are due to all the
infantry regiments of Her Majesty, and to the first
European Light Infantry of the East India Company’s
Service, all of which regiments distinguished themselves
by the most devoted courage in braving the
destructive fire of the enemy’s batteries, and valiantly
capturing their guns.”</p>
</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thus ended the year 1845. The Sikhs, after having
suffered two severe defeats, were preparing to renew the
contest; they had made large additions to their army,
and had again collected a formidable train of artillery.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1846</div>

<p>On the 16th of January, 1846, the first brigade, with
a few guns and some Native cavalry, received sudden
orders to march on the following morning in the
direction of Loodiana, under the command of Major-General
Sir Henry Smith; by a forced march on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
17th, the fort of <em>Dhurrumkote</em> was surprised, and the
garrison, consisting of about three hundred men, laid
down their arms, and were sent prisoners to head-quarters.
On the 20th of the same month, this division
was reinforced near the fort of Jugraon by the sixteenth
lancers, the fifty-third foot, a detachment of
recruits of the Queen’s regiments, and a troop of horse
artillery.</p>

<p>The Major-General decided on attempting the relief
of Loodiana, which was but slightly garrisoned, and
was threatened by a large body of the enemy. Jugraon
is distant from Loodiana about twenty-five miles, and
the road (if road it can be called) is over a heavy and
sandy soil. The troops were formed, and commenced
their march about one o’clock on the morning of the
21st; about eleven <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> the enemy was observed to be
drawn up, parallel with the British line of march, in a
strong position at <em>Buddiwal</em>, his front covered by a ridge
of low sand-hills, bristling with forty pieces of artillery,
which were so placed that it was necessary, in order to
gain Loodiana, either to risk a battle to dislodge him
from a strong position,&mdash;which, with troops fatigued by
a long march, under a burning sun, and greatly inferior
in numbers, would have been a hazardous proceeding,&mdash;or
to march along the entire front of his position under
a galling fire.</p>

<p>Major-General Sir Henry Smith, having a just confidence
in the steadiness of his troops, chose the latter.
The infantry, formed in open column of companies right
in front (the grenadier company of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>
leading), and ready at any moment to form line, preceded
by the artillery, and covered by the cavalry,
marched at a distance of five hundred yards, along the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
front of this formidable line, receiving the fire of each
battery as it bore upon them. The regiment formed
line on the grenadier company.</p>

<p>On this occasion, and under the fire of forty guns,
the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> received an order from Sir Henry
Smith to change front to the rear on the centre, a
movement which was rendered necessary by the manœuvres
of the enemy, who had thrown forward his right
in such a manner as to get into the rear of the British;
this movement could not be attempted without the most
perfect steadiness on the part of the men, and it was
performed in such a manner as to call forth the praises
of the Major-General. This was the first time this
manœuvre was ever done under fire of the enemy; after
which, the retirement of corps in line, covered by the
sixteenth lancers, to relieve Loodiana (the object being
to relieve that place), was beautifully executed.</p>

<p>The Sikh position being passed, and the enemy
declining to follow, by three o’clock in the afternoon the
troops arrived at Loodiana, thus effecting Sir Henry
Smith’s object. In this affair the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> lost
21 men killed and wounded; and 19 men, who had, from
the length and severity of the march, been unable to
keep up with the column, were taken prisoners. The
greatest part of the baggage belonging to the division
was taken by the enemy.</p>

<p>On the 22nd and 23rd the troops were permitted to
rest themselves after their late fatigues, and on the
24th the enemy retired to <em>Aliwal</em>, a village on the
Sutlej. The British force moved to the ground
lately occupied by them at Buddiwal, where it was
reinforced by the second brigade of Sir Henry Smith’s
division, consisting of Her Majesty’s fiftieth foot,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
and forty-eighth Native infantry, from head-quarters,
with some cavalry and infantry from Loodiana.</p>

<p>On the 28th of January at daylight, Major-General
Sir Henry Smith marched with his whole force to attack
the enemy under Sirdar Runjoor Singh and the Rajah
of Ladwa in their camps at Aliwal, but found him, on
approaching it, drawn up in line of battle, with his
left resting on the village. From information afterwards
received, it appeared that the Sikhs were about
to march upon Jugraon that very morning, for the
purpose of getting between Sir Henry Smith’s force
and the heavy guns coming up from Delhi under a
very slender escort. The march having been previously
conducted in column of brigades at deploying
distance, each brigade deployed on its leading company,
and thus formed one long line. The troops advanced
on the enemy, distant about one mile and a half, and
about ten <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> the action was commenced by a heavy
cannonade from the Sikh artillery, which was principally
directed on the British centre. The village of
<em>Aliwal</em> was filled with infantry, supported by cavalry
in the rear, and further defended by two guns on its
left, immediately opposite that part of the line occupied
by the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment. The village was
carried, and the two guns were captured.</p>

<p>The line, being somewhat disordered in carrying the
village, was quickly re-formed, and advanced in excellent
order, carrying everything before it. The attack
of the enemy by the left wing was equally successful.
The line advanced, and made a steady and
successful charge; the enemy, being everywhere
beaten, gave way, and fled towards the river in the
utmost confusion, leaving his camp and fifty-two pieces<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
of artillery, as trophies in the hands of the victors.
A standard was captured here by the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>
regiment; also a gurry, or gong.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>The advance of the British force in order of battle
is thus described by Major-General Sir Henry Smith
in his despatch containing an account of the action:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“As I neared the enemy, the ground became most
favourable for troops to manœuvre, being open and
hard grass-land. I ordered the cavalry to take
ground to the right and left by brigades, thus
displaying the heads of the infantry columns, and as
they reached the high ground, I directed them to
deploy into line. After deployment I observed the
enemy’s left to outflank me; I therefore broke into
open columns and took ground to my right; when I
had gained sufficient ground, the troops wheeled into
line: there was no dust; the sun shone brightly.
These manœuvres were performed with the celerity
and precision of the most correct field-day; the
glistening of the bayonets and the swords of this
order of battle was most imposing, and the line
advanced. Scarcely had it moved forward 150 paces,
when at ten o’clock the enemy opened a fierce<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
cannonade from his whole line. At first his balls
fell short, but quickly reached us. Thus upon him,
and capable of better ascertaining his position, I
was compelled to halt the line, though under fire, for
a few moments, until I ascertained that by bringing
up my right, and carrying the village of Aliwal, I
could with great effect precipitate myself on his left
and centre; I therefore quickly brought up Brigadier
Godby’s brigade, and, with it and the first brigade
under Brigadier Hicks, made a rapid and noble charge,
carried the village and two guns of large calibre.
The line I ordered to advance. Her Majesty’s <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>
regiment and the Native regiments contending
for the front, the battle became <span class="nowrap">general. * * *</span>
The battle was won; our troops advancing with the
most perfect order to the common focus, the passage
of the river. The enemy, completely hemmed in,
were flying from our fire, and precipitating themselves
in disordered masses into the ford and boats, in the
utmost confusion and <span class="nowrap">consternation. * * *</span></p>

<p>“Thus ended the <em>Battle of Aliwal</em>, one of the most
glorious victories ever achieved in India. By the
united efforts of Her Majesty’s and the Honorable
Company’s troops, every gun the enemy had, fell into
our hands: fifty-two guns are now in the Ordnance,
two sunk in the bed of the Sutlej, and two spiked on
the opposite bank, making a total of fifty-six pieces
of cannon captured or destroyed!</p>

<p>“Having thus done justice, and justice alone, to the
gallant troops his Excellency trusted to my command,
I would gladly, if the limits of a despatch permitted
me, do that justice to individuals all deserve. This
cannot be; therefore I must confine myself to mention<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
those officers whose continued services, experience,
and standing placed them in conspicuous commands.”</p>
</div>

<p>After lauding the gallant service performed by the
artillery, Sir Henry Smith proceeds to state in his
official despatch:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“To Brigadiers MacDowell and Stedman, commanding
their gallant, brigades of cavalry, the fortune of
the day is greatly indebted, and to all commanding
officers of cavalry and infantry my warmest thanks
are due; to Major Smyth, commanding the sixteenth
lancers; to Lieut.-Colonel Spence, commanding Her
Majesty’s <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> foot; to Lieut.-Colonel Ryan,
K.H., commanding Her Majesty’s fiftieth regiment;
and to Lieut.-Colonel Phillips, commanding Her
Majesty’s fifty-third foot.</p>

<p>“His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief having
witnessed the glorious services of Her Majesty’s
<span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> and fiftieth regiments, I have only to
report upon Her Majesty’s fifty-third, a young regiment,
but veterans in daring gallantry and regularity.</p>

<p>“To Captain Lugard (<span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment) the
Assistant-Adjutant-General of this force, I am deeply
indebted, and the service still more so; a more cool,
intrepid, and trustworthy officer cannot be brought
forward.</p>

<p>“The brigadiers all speak in high terms of their
majors of brigade, Captain O’Hanlan, of the second
brigade, and Captain Garvock, of Her Majesty’s
<span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> foot, of the first brigade.”</p>
</div>

<p>The loss of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment in this conflict
was fortunately small: one officer, Lieut. Atty, slightly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
wounded, and fifteen men killed and wounded. The
troops bivouacked for the night near the field of battle.
The army remained at Aliwal five days, during which
the following General Order was received from General
Sir Hugh Gough, the Commander-in-Chief:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">General Orders to the Army of the Sutlej.</span></p>

<p class="fs80 right">“Head-Quarters, Camp, Nihalkee,<br />
“29th January, 1846.</p>

<p>“A glorious victory, with the capture of all the
enemy’s guns, having been achieved by the force
under Major-General Sir Henry Smith, K.C.B., the
whole line will parade at eight o’clock this morning
for the inspection of the Right Honorable the
Governor-General and his Excellency the Commander-in-Chief,
and a royal salute will be fired
from the eighteen-pounder battery, and three cheers
will be given by the line after the salute, in celebration
of this triumphant event.”</p>
</div>

<p>The following extract is taken from the General
Orders issued by the Governor-General, dated “Camp,
Ferozepore, 2nd of February, 1846:”&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Great praise is due to Brigadier Hicks, who, with
Her Majesty’s <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment, the twenty-fourth
and forty-seventh Native infantry, stormed
the village of <em>Aliwal</em>, drove the enemy from it, and
seized the guns by which it was defended.”</p>
</div>

<p>Extract of the despatch of the Governor-General
of India to the Secret Committee, dated “Camp,
Kanha Kutchwa, 19th of February, 1846:”&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The immediate result of the victory of Aliwal
was the evacuation by the Sikh garrisons of all the
forts hitherto occupied by detachments of Lahore
soldiers on this side of the river Sutlej, and the submission<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
of the whole of the territory on the left bank
of that river to the British government.</p>

<p>“The Sikh army remained in its intrenched position;
and though, on the first intelligence of the victory
of Aliwal, and at the sight of the numerous bodies
which floated from the neighbourhood of that battle-field
to the bridge of boats at Sobraon, the Sikhs
seemed much shaken and disheartened,&mdash;yet after a
few days, the Sikh troops seemed to be as confident as
ever of being able to defy us in their intrenched position,
and to prevent our passage of the river.</p>

<p>“The Commander-in-Chief was not in a state to take
advantage of the enemy’s defeat at <em>Aliwal</em>, by an
attack on his intrenched position at <em>Sobraon</em>, until the
troops under Major-General Sir Henry Smith should
have rejoined his Excellency’s camp, and the siege-train
and ammunition should have arrived from Delhi.
The first portion of the siege-train, with the reserved
ammunition for 100 guns, reached the Commander-in-Chief’s
camp on the 7th and 8th of February. On
the latter day the brigades, which had been detached
from the main army, rejoined the Commander-in-Chief.”</p>
</div>

<p>Notwithstanding the signal defeat in the battles of
<em>Moodkee</em>, <em>Ferozeshah</em>, and <em>Aliwal</em>, and the loss of 143
pieces of artillery captured by the British in these
actions, the enemy determined to persevere in his rash
project of invading the British dominions. For this
purpose he made extraordinary efforts; he had collected
all his available troops, and assembled a large army
on the left bank of the Sutlej, near the village of
<em>Sobraon</em>. Here the Sikhs formed an intrenched camp,
defended by 30,000 men with 70 pieces of artillery;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
this camp was supported by a large reserve on the
opposite side of the river, the communication being
preserved by a bridge of boats.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment, under its distinguished
and experienced leader, Major-General Sir Henry
Smith, rejoined the head-quarter camp on the 8th of
February, just in time for the crowning and decisive
victory of <em>Sobraon</em>. The arrival of Sir Henry Smith’s
force enabled the Commander-in-Chief to carry his
plan of attacking the enemy into execution. Two
days were allowed, that this division should rest after
its fatigues.</p>

<p>The entrenched camp of the Sikhs was in a position
judiciously chosen in a bend of the river, about five or
six miles from the British camp. The defences of
the enemy were constructed scientifically by European
engineers.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 10th of February, some
hours before daylight, the several divisions were
silently formed in column of attack. Major-General Sir
Henry Smith’s division was on the extreme right; it
was formed into two lines; the first line consisted of
the first brigade, to which the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment
belonged, under Lieut.-Colonel Spence: this line was
supported by the second brigade at a short distance in
the rear. When the day dawned, the first brigade
found itself about three-quarters of a mile in front of
the enemy’s works. The cannonading, which commenced
a little after daylight, continued with little
interruption, until about nine <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> A stray shot
was now and then sent at the regiment, but did
no damage, when orders were given to the infantry
to advance to the attack. The men, who had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
lying down, instantly jumped up, formed line, and
advanced.</p>

<p>The ground immediately in front of the enemy’s
works was very irregular, which made it difficult for
the men to keep their places. The enemy’s fire, which
commenced at a distance of two or three hundred yards,
grew gradually more and more heavy; and firing, as
the Sikhs did, from behind lofty entrenchments at the
assaulting party, who offered a fair mark as they
scrambled up the ramparts, they shot down a number
of the British troops, while the survivors, after in vain
attempting to reach the top, the loose nature of the
soil rendering the footing extremely insecure, were compelled
to fall back on the advancing second brigade,
who saw with indignation that the enemy were hacking
the wounded.</p>

<p>The line was quickly re-formed and advanced a second
time; the same determined resistance was again made:
but the men, burning to revenge their comrades, would
not be deterred. Here Lieut. Tritton, bearing the
Queen’s colour, was shot through the head; and Ensign
Jones,<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> who carried the regimental colour, was, nearly
at the same time, mortally wounded; the regimental
colour, falling to the ground, was seized by Serjeant
Bernard M‘Cabe, who, rushing forward, crossed the
ditch and planted it on the ramparts. The men cheering,
scrambled into the works as best they could, and
drove the enemy, who were beaten at all points, before
them into the river, Lieut. Noel gallantly carrying
the Queen’s colour in front of the regiment, the staff of
which was shivered in his hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span></p>

<p>The attack having been everywhere successful, the
slaughter of the Sikhs, as they crossed the river, was
tremendous. Many casualties, however, in the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>
regiment occurred within the enemy’s works.
Lieutenant Timbrell was dangerously wounded by a
grape-shot, which broke both his thighs, and Lieutenant
Elmslie was also severely wounded by a musket-ball.
Captain Garvock, Major of Brigade, and Lieutenant
and Adjutant Bolton, were both severely wounded
outside the works, where Lieutenants Gabbett and
Law were also wounded. Thirty-five rank and file were
killed, and 102 wounded.</p>

<p>Two stands of colours were captured by the regiment,
making four stands altogether.</p>

<p>The first brigade, on this glorious occasion, was commanded
by Lieutenant-Colonel Spence, whose horse
was shot during the advance, and the sword in his
hand bent nearly double by a grape-shot.</p>

<p>Captain White, the senior Captain, being left sick
at Loodiana, from the effects of the sun on service,
Captain Longworth commanded the regiment during
the action. He was promoted for his gallant conduct
to be major in the army; his horse was killed under
him. Captains Garvock and Lugard were also promoted
to be majors in the army on the same occasion.</p>

<p>The following account of the action is given in
Captain Longworth’s despatch, dated 11th of February,
1846:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="fs80 right">“Camp, Attia, 11th February, 1846.</p>

<p class="smcap noindent">“Sir,</p>

<p>“I have the honor to state for the information of
the Brigadier, that H. M.’s <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment,
under my command, marched from Camp Tulwondee
yesterday morning at four <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, in quarter-distance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
column, right in front, being the leading
regiment of the first brigade, first division. We advanced
in this order till within about two miles of the
enemy’s position, and then halted, formed line, and
waited till daybreak, when we advanced some distance
and halted till sunrise, and again advancing
halted with our right resting on the Sutlej within
range of the enemy’s guns; here we remained about
two hours, when we were ordered to advance. This
was no sooner discovered by the enemy than they
opened upon us a most tremendous fire of round shot
from the whole of the guns upon the left flank of
their intrenched camp; shell, grape, canister, and a
very heavy fire of musketry were showered upon us as
we neared the fortifications: but in spite of this, I am
proud to say, the regiment advanced steadily and in
the best order till within thirty paces of the intrenched
camp, when a most destructive fire from overpowering
numbers forced us to retire to a short distance, for
the purpose of re-forming, as we left a full third of
the regiment upon the ground; and I feel convinced
that had the regiment remained for five minutes
longer in its exposed situation it must have been annihilated,
as our fire was totally ineffectual against
the enemy’s strongly fortified position, which completely
protected them, until by a desperate charge,
in conjunction with H. M.’s Fiftieth Regiment, we
succeeded in penetrating the extremity of their works
extending to the river, and thereby were enabled to
bring our fire to bear upon their gunners, who with
the most desperate courage turned their guns upon
the portion of their own camp in our possession, and
fought till bayoneted where they stood. Their infantry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
in masses now retiring, we followed them up,
and, in concert with the other branches of the army,
shot and bayoneted them into the river, where immense
numbers were brought down by our fire.
Shortly after the battle was over the regiment was
ordered into camp.</p>

<p>“I beg to bring to your notice the gallant conduct of
Serjeant M‘Cabe of the light company, who planted
the regimental colour on the highest point of the
enemy’s fortifications, and maintained his position
under a most tremendous fire, the colour being completely
riddled by the enemy’s shot;&mdash;he did this after
the officer carrying the colour <ins class="corr" id="tn-149" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;This footnote anchor was missing in the original text.">
was shot.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></ins> I beg further
to bring to your notice Private Williams of No. 7
company, and Private Biffin of the light company, who
each took a colour from the enemy, one of which is supposed
to have belonged to their artillery. I have much
pleasure in expressing my high approbation of both
officers and men under my command for their gallant
conduct throughout the day. I regret to add that
Lieutenant Law, my second in command, and Lieutenant
and Adjutant Bolton, were both severely
wounded.</p>

<p>On the 14th of February, 1846, the Governor-General
published a General Order, dated from his camp at
Kussoor, from which the following extracts are taken:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Governor-General, having received from his
Excellency the Commander-in-Chief the despatch
annexed, announces to the army and to the people of
India, for the fourth time during this campaign, a
most important and memorable victory obtained by
the army of the Sutlej over the Sikh forces at
<em>Sobraon</em>, on the 10th instant.</p>

<p>“On that day the enemy’s strongly intrenched
camp, defended by 35,000 men and 67 pieces of
artillery, exclusive of heavy guns on the opposite
bank of the river, was stormed by the British Army
under the immediate command of His Excellency
Sir Hugh Gough, and in two hours the Sikh forces
were driven into the river with immense loss,
67 guns being captured by the victors.</p>

<p>“The Governor-General most cordially congratulates
the Commander-in-Chief and the British Army
on this exploit, one of the most daring ever achieved,
by which in open day a triple line of breastworks,
flanked by formidable redoubts, bristling with
artillery, manned by thirty-two regular regiments of
infantry, was assaulted, and carried by the forces
under His Excellency’s command.</p>

<p>“This important operation was most judiciously
preceded by a cannonade from the heavy howitzers
and mortars, which had arrived from Delhi on the
8th of February, the same day on which the forces
under Major-General Sir Henry Smith, which had
been detached to Loodiana, and had gained the victory
of Aliwal, rejoined the Commander-in-Chief’s camp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span></p>

<p>“The British infantry, formed on the extreme left
of the line, then advanced to the assault, and, in
spite of every impediment, cleared the intrenchments
and entered the enemy’s camp. Her Majesty’s tenth,
fifty-third, and eightieth regiments, moving at a firm
and steady pace, never fired a shot until they had
passed the barriers opposed to them, a forbearance
much to be commended, and most worthy of constant
imitation, to which may be attributed the success of
their first effort, and the small loss they sustained.
The attack was crowned with the success it deserved!</p>

<p>“The same gallant efforts, attended by the same
success, distinguished the attack on the enemy’s left,
made by the first division, under the command of
Major-General Sir Henry Smith, K.C.B., in which
the troops nobly sustained their former reputation.</p>

<p>“These three divisions of infantry, concentrated
within the enemy’s camp, drove the shattered forces
into the river, with a loss which far exceeded that
which the most experienced officers had ever
witnessed.</p>

<p>“Thus terminated, in the brief space of two hours,
this most remarkable conflict, in which the military
combinations of the Commander-in-Chief were fully
and ably carried into effect with His Excellency’s
characteristic energy; the enemy’s select regiments of
regular infantry have been dispersed, and a large
portion destroyed, with the loss, since the campaign
began, of 220 pieces of artillery taken in <span class="nowrap">action. * * *</span></p>

<p>“The Governor-General, in the name of the Government
and of the people of India, offers to His Excellency
the Commander-in-Chief,&mdash;to the General<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
Officers, and all the Officers and Troops under their
command, his grateful and heartfelt acknowledgments
for the services they have <span class="nowrap">performed. * * *</span></p>

<p>“The Governor-General acknowledges the meritorious
conduct of Brigadier Penny, and Lieut.-Colonel
Spence,<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> commanding brigades in the first division.</p>

<p>“Her Majesty’s <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> and fiftieth regiments
greatly distinguished themselves, as well as the forty-second
and forty-seventh native infantry, and the
Nusseeree battalion.”</p>
</div>

<p>The despatch of the Commander-in-Chief, General
Sir Hugh Gough, to the Governor-General, dated
Camp, Kussoor, 13th of February, 1846, giving a detailed
account of the battle of Sobraon, contained the
following expressions of approbation and thanks:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have now to make the attempt,&mdash;difficult, nay
impracticable, though I deem it,&mdash;of expressing in
adequate terms my sense of obligation to those who
especially aided me by their talents and self-devotion
in the hard-fought field of <em>Sobraon</em>.</p>

<p>“The major-generals of the divisions engaged
deserve far more commendation than I am able,
within the limits of a despatch, to <span class="nowrap">bestow. * * *</span></p>

<p>“Brigadier Penny and Lieut.-Colonel Spence commanded
the two brigades of Major-General Sir Henry
Smith’s division, and overcame at their head the
most formidable opposition. I beg to bring both in
the most earnest manner to your <span class="nowrap">notice. * * *</span></p>

BATTLE OF SOBRAON 10<sup>th</sup> FEB<sup>y</sup> 1846<br />
<em>For Cannon’s Military Records</em>
</div>
</div>

<p>“The Sikhs, even when at particular points their
intrenchments were mastered with the bayonet,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
strove to regain them by the fiercest conflict, sword in
hand. Nor was it until the cavalry of the left, under
Major-General Sir Joseph Thackwell, had moved
forward and ridden through the openings in the
intrenchments made by our sappers, in single file,
and re-formed as they passed them; and the third
light dragoons, whom no obstacle usually held
formidable by horse appears to check, had, on this
day, as at Ferozeshah, galloped over and cut down
the obstinate defenders of batteries and field-works,
and until the full weight of <em>three divisions is of infantry</em>,
with every field-artillery gun which could be sent to
their aid, had been cast into the scale, that victory
finally declared for the British.</p>

<p>“The fire of the Sikhs first slackened and then
nearly ceased, and the victors, then pressing them on
every side, precipitated them in masses over their
bridge and into the Sutlej, which a sudden rise of
seven inches had rendered hardly fordable. In their
efforts to reach the right bank through the deepened
water, they suffered from our horse artillery a
terrible carnage. Hundreds fell under this cannonade:
hundreds upon hundreds were drowned in attempting
the perilous passage. Their awful slaughter, confusion,
and dismay were such as would have excited
compassion in the hearts of their generous conquerors,
if the Khalsa troops had not, in the earlier part of the
action, sullied their gallantry by slaughtering and
barbarously mangling every wounded soldier whom,
in the vicissitudes of attack, the fortune of war left at
their mercy.</p>

<p>“Sixty-seven pieces of cannon, upwards of two
hundred camel-swivels (zumboorucks), numerous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
standards, and vast munitions of war, captured by
our troops, are the pledges and trophies of our victory.</p>

<p>“The battle was over by eleven in the morning, and
in the forenoon I caused our engineers to burn a part
and to sink a part of the vaunted bridge of the
Khalsa army, across which they had boastfully come
once more to defy us, and to threaten India with
ruin and devastation.</p>

<p>“The consequences of this great action have yet to
be fully developed. It has at least, in God’s providence,
once more expelled the Sikhs from our territory,
and planted our standards on the soil of the
Punjaub. After occupying their intrenched position
for nearly a month, the Khalsa army had perhaps
mistaken the <em>caution</em> which had induced us to wait
for the necessary materiel, for <em>timidity</em>; but they
must now deeply feel that the blow, which has fallen
on them from the British arm, has only been the
heavier for being long delayed.”</p>
</div>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel Spence, Captain Garvock (Major of
Brigade), and Captain Lugard (Deputy Assistant
Adjutant-General) of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>, were specially
mentioned in the above despatch.</p>

<p>At the close of a despatch dated Camp, Lahore,
22nd of February, 1846, the Governor-General added
the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The soldiers of the army of the Sutlej have not
only proved their superior prowess in battle, but have
on every occasion, with subordination and patience,
endured the fatigues and privations inseparable from
a state of active operations in the field.</p>

<p>“The Governor-General has repeatedly expressed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
on his own part, and on that of the Government of
India, admiration and gratitude for the important
services which the army has rendered.</p>

<p>“The Governor-General is now pleased to resolve, as
a testimony of the approbation of the Government
of India of the bravery, discipline, and soldierlike
bearing of the army of the Sutlej, that all the generals,
officers, non-commissioned officers, and privates, shall
receive a gratuity of twelve months’ batta.”</p>
</div>

<p>In writing the history of the part borne by a regiment
in the brilliant victories of this glorious campaign,
there are many traits of individual heroism which
should not pass unrecorded. The modesty of true
valour prevents officers, who have had an opportunity
of distinguishing themselves, from announcing their
own deeds, but the historian, who impartially records
the service of a corps, can have no such scruples.
No hesitation is therefore felt in giving a place in the
records of the service of this distinguished corps to the
following extract from the Calcutta Star, an Indian
newspaper, which described the recent battles of the
Sutlej:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Thirty-first Regiment.</span>&mdash;This gallant old corps
seems to have received more than its share of hard
knocks, in the last four glorious battles it was engaged
in. Lieut.-Colonel Spence who commanded in
all four actions, seems to have had a charmed life,
having escaped in a most astonishing way. He had
two horses killed under him; balls through his cap
and scabbard; his sword broken in his hand by
grape-shot; and at Sobraon, a Sikh, who was lying
apparently dead in the trenches, jumped up when
he saw the Colonel’s head turned, and rushed at him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
to cut him down, which was only prevented by a
private who called the Colonel’s attention to his
danger, and afterwards bayoneted the Sikh, the
Colonel’s sword having broken in the encounter.”</p>
</div>

<p>The glorious <em>Victory of Sobraon</em> was decisive: the invaders
were repelled; their army, discomfited, retreated
sullenly from the field; the whole of their artillery,
their camp, warlike stores, and baggage fell into
the hands of the victors; the enemy retired over their
bridge, which, from the weight and pressure of the
immense mass of the defeated troops passing over it,
gave way; the Sikhs were precipitated into the water;
the whole river was filled with the confused bodies of
the flying enemy, the British artillery playing on them
with round and grape-shot; the stream was choked
up with the dead and dying: the carnage was
frightful!</p>

<p>The enemy never attempted to rally. With the
loss of his artillery, on which all his confidence was
placed, his spirit was broken, and all his hopes of
successfully resisting the British troops vanished: his
pride was humbled: the last and final struggle was over;
the battle was ended, and the power of the haughty
and turbulent Sikhs received a blow on the sanguinary
field of <em>Sobraon</em> from which it could not recover: the
city of <em>Lahore</em> was at the mercy of the conquerors.</p>

<p>Preparations were now made for the advance of the
British army into the Punjaub; the engineer department
constructed a pontoon-bridge, and the whole
British force, with its artillery, passed the Sutlej, and
encamped on the opposite side, in the territory of the
Sikhs: the enemy, disheartened and dismayed by their
late defeats offered no opposition, retiring as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
British army advanced. The distance from the river
Sutlej to the capital of the Sikhs is less than fifty miles;
the march to it was performed without opposition, and
without difficulty: the power of the Sikhs was prostrate;
their government sent chiefs of high rank as ambassadors
to the British camp, to offer terms of submission
to the Governor-General, suing for peace on whatever
terms the conquerors might please to dictate.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Tritton died of his wounds on the evening
of the battle, and early the next morning the regiment
marched towards the bridge of boats, which was in progress
at the nearest point on the Sutlej to Ferozepore;
on this march it was joined by a detachment of sixty
men under the command of Lieutenant M‘Kenzie,
along with Assistant-Surgeon Massey, who had just
arrived from Umballa, being part of an escort in
charge of heavy guns, and an immense train of ammunition
hackeries, which they had hoped to bring up in
time for the last great battle, and were sadly disappointed
to find it was all over;&mdash;such are the chances
of war!! On the 12th the regiment was turned out
at 10 o’clock <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, and marching all night, crossed the
river in native boats at sunrise, along with a large
force under Sir Henry Smith, the band in the first boat
playing “Garry-Owen,” and the men in high spirits
at the prospect of entering the Punjaub.</p>

<p>This forced march was effected from a report having
been sent to the Commander-in-Chief, that the Sikhs
were about to oppose the crossing of the river, but no
such demonstration took place. After halting some
days at Kussoor, which is one march from the Sutlej, the
army moved towards Lahore, marching at daylight
every morning in order of battle, and every regiment in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
brigade keeping its own place through fields and
jungles, forcing a way through every obstacle, and
ready to form line at any moment. It was indeed a
grand sight to see this splendid army on the morning
of the 20th of February approaching the city of
Lahore, over a boundless and perfectly open plain,
on which it encamped about two miles from the city.
On the 22nd the British Standard was hoisted on
the citadel, and the event was announced to the army
by the following General Orders of the Governor-General:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="smcap center">General Orders by the Right Honorable the
Governor-General of India.</p>

<p class="fs80 right">“Camp, Lahore, 22nd February, 1846.</p>

<p>“The British army has this day occupied the gateway
of the citadel of <em>Lahore</em>, the Badshahee Mosque, and
the Huzzooree Bagh.</p>

<p>“The <em>Army of the Sutlej</em> has now brought its operations
in the field to a close, by the dispersion of the
Sikh army, and the military occupation of Lahore,
preceded by a series of the most triumphant successes
ever recorded in the military history of India.</p>

<p>“Compelled suddenly to assume the offensive by the
unprovoked invasion of its territories, the British
Army, under the command of its distinguished leader,
has in sixty days defeated the Sikh forces in four
general actions, has captured 220 pieces of field-artillery,
and is now at the capital, dictating to the Lahore
durbar the terms of a treaty, the conditions of which
will tend to secure the British provinces from the
repetition of a similar outrage.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span></p>

<p>The decisive termination of the war in the Punjaub
enabled the Governor-General and the Supreme
Council to reduce the number of the Queen’s regular
regiments in India. An order was accordingly issued
for the return of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> to Europe, but as it
was desirable to retain all the efficient men who were
willing to continue their services in India, the soldiers
were permitted to volunteer into the other regiments
serving in the Bengal Presidency.</p>

<p>A General Order was issued permitting the soldiers
of the sixteenth lancers and the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment
to volunteer into other corps; the volunteering of the
<span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> to commence on the 26th and to close on
the 28th of February.</p>

<p>The regiment now mustered only 420 bayonets fit for
duty out of 844 which left Umballa, and during these
three days 103 men volunteered to other corps; at
Umballa, on the 23rd, 24th, and 25th of March, it again
volunteered 214 men; and at Chinsurah, on the 10th
of July, 12 men, in all 329, who remained in India.
Within the last few years, the regiment had gained
a considerable accession to its strength by volunteers
from corps leaving India: these men, whose object
in volunteering was to remain in India, again availed
themselves of the General Order granting them a
bounty, of thirty rupees, and volunteered into other
corps with which they had served during the late
campaign.</p>

<p>After the authority for volunteering had taken effect
the strength of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment was much
reduced: all the young soldiers who were desirous of
serving in India volunteered into other regiments.
Several of the officers exchanged into corps remaining<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
in India: Lieut.-Colonel Byrne into the fifty-third
regiment; Major Young into the tenth; and Brevet Major
Lugard into the twenty-ninth.</p>

<p>On the publication of the General Order for the
return of the regiment to Europe,&mdash;the following
Division Order was issued by Major-General Sir
Henry Smith, K.C.B., commanding the first division:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="fs80 right">“Camp, Lahore, 3rd March, 1846.</p>

<p>“Comrades,&mdash;Officers and Soldiers of the gallant
<span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment,&mdash;you and I have been so associated
in the recent conflicts, where your services have
been distinguished, that I cannot lose you from under
my command without an expression of the deepest
regret; that regret is however mitigated, when I
know that you are about to return to your native
country, from which the regiment has been absent
twenty-one years,&mdash;much diminished in numbers,&mdash;caused
by your valiant conduct and recent glorious victories;
but the former renown of your distinguished
corps has acquired additional fame, by the valour of
Lieut.-Colonel Spence, the officers, and soldiers; and
the long list of triumphant victories now recorded on
your colours, has been much increased by your services
in India. Farewell, my gallant comrades, for
the present; may every success, happiness, honor,
and prosperity attend you, the gallant <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>
regiment, in peace, as it has so gloriously done in
war! and, believe me, one of the most happy and
proud recollections of my life will be that I have
witnessed the indomitable valour of the corps.”</p>
</div>

<p>On the same occasion the following Brigade Orders<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
were issued by Brigadier Monteath, who commanded
the brigade in which the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment

<p class="smcap center">Brigade Orders by Brigadier Monteath, C.B.</p>

<p>“Her Majesty’s <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment being now
about to quit the army, Brigadier Monteath cannot
allow it to depart without expressing the deep regret
he feels at the approaching separation from those to
whom he has been bound by so many ties of friendly
feeling for their private good qualities, and high
admiration for their public services. On a former occasion,
when associated with them under the most difficult
and trying circumstances, he had the gratification of
recording, that the regiment had exhibited, in a high
degree, the best qualities of the best British soldiers;
and he has now the proud pleasure of telling them,
that by their gallant conduct during the late sanguinary
conflicts with the enemy, they have encircled
themselves with every honor, nobly maintained the
former character of the regiment, and placed its
number amongst the foremost of those whose military
achievements are most conspicuously engraved upon
the records of their country; and he sincerely prays,
on their arrival in England, that their beloved
Sovereign may be induced to confer such marks of
distinction upon the regiment as its gallant deeds
so eminently deserve.</p>

<p>“Farewell, my gallant comrades; may every happiness
and prosperity attend you. Your old Commander

</div>

<p>The Commander-in-Chief in India, having deemed it
advisable to send home as many of the severely wounded
men of the army as possible, before the beginning of the
hot weather, gave orders for the boats to be prepared
on the Sutlej to convey them to Bombay, and the
command of this detachment was given by His Excellency
to Lieutenant Robertson, of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>
regiment. It consisted of about 158 men of all the
European corps lately engaged, and an escort of 63
duty men of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>, making in all 221,
97 of which belonged to the regiment. The detachment
sailed from Ferozepore on the 14th of March,
1846, and arrived safely at Bombay on the 27th of
April, whence it embarked on board the ship ‘Herefordshire’
on the 14th of May, and landed at Gravesend
on the 29th of September, 1846, being the first
portion of the regiment that arrived in England.</p>

<p>On the 28th of February the officers of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>
regiment were specially invited to dinner by
Lieut.-General Lord Hardinge, the Governor-General,
and on the 3rd of March the same honor was conferred
on them by General Lord Gough, the Commander-in-Chief
in India.</p>

<p>The volunteering being completed, the volunteers
were delivered over to their new corps. The regiment
separated from the army with which it had
gained such distinguished renown, and commenced
its march on the 4th of March towards Ghurmuktesir<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
Ghât, on the river Ganges, where boats were prepared
for its conveyance to Calcutta. The regiment recrossed
the river Sutlej on the 7th of March, and on
the 20th reached Umballa.</p>

<p>The women, children, and baggage of the regiment,
having been left at Umballa when the regiment proceeded
on service, a halt was required to enable the
officers to arrange their affairs and dispose of their
property, and that of the deceased officers and men;
the houses which the officers occupied being their
own property and built by themselves, as they were
the first to inhabit the station when it was formed into
a new cantonment in 1843.</p>

<p>The regiment moved again on the 28th of March,
and, passing through the station of Meerut, arrived at
Ghurmuktesir Ghât, on the right bank of the Ganges,
on the 13th of April.</p>

<p>The boats provided by the commissariat for the
conveyance of the regiment to Calcutta being in
readiness for the voyage, the wounded and sick men,
women, and children were embarked with as little
delay as possible. By the 16th of April the whole were
embarked, and the fleet of boats sailed for the Presidency
of Calcutta on the following day.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel Spence, after having commanded
the regiment in every action during this brilliant
and glorious campaign,&mdash;at <em>Moodkee</em> on the 18th of
December, <em>Ferozeshah</em> on the 21st and 22nd of December,
1845, <em>Buddiwal</em> on the 21st of January, <em>Aliwal</em> on
the 28th, and on the 10th of February, 1846, at the
crowning victory at <em>Sobraon</em>,&mdash;had now the satisfaction
of embarking with it on board the boats appointed to
convey it to the port of Calcutta, where the ships lay<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
at anchor, which were engaged to carry the war-worn
veterans of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment to their native
country.</p>

<p>On the 3rd of April Her Majesty was pleased to appoint
Lieut.-Colonel Byrne and Lieut.-Colonel Spence,
of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment, to be Companions of the
Most Honorable Military Order of the Bath, for their
distinguished gallantry in the late actions on the
Sutlej.</p>

<p>In consequence of the particularly gallant conduct
of Serjeant Bernard M‘Cabe, Major-General Sir Henry
Smith, in a letter dated 17th February, was pleased to
recommend him for a commission, in the following
terms:&mdash;“This intrepid non-commissioned officer, in
the midst of a hand-to-hand conflict with the enemy,
planted the colour of Her Majesty’s <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>
regiment upon one of the towers of the enemy’s
intrenchments,&mdash;one of the most bold and daring acts
of a gallant soldier I ever witnessed, and which, I now
deliberately consider, tended much to shorten the
struggle alluded to. This serjeant is a young man
of excellent character, and, if I may be permitted to
remind His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief of
the promise made me almost in the heat of battle, it is,&mdash;‘<em>This
Serjeant shall be recommended for a commission</em>.’
I can only add (which is unnecessary to the soldiers’
friend, Sir Hugh Gough) that, if he receives a
commission, it will be as gratifying to me as was the
gallant conduct I witnessed at the moment the
colour-head was shot off, and the flag perforated with
balls, as he triumphantly waved it in the air in the
very midst of the enemy.”</p>

<p>This highly honorable testimony of the bravery of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
Serjeant M‘Cabe at the battle of Sobraon, was supported
by the strong recommendation of General Lord
Gough to His Grace the Commander-in-Chief, and
Serjeant Bernard M‘Cabe was appointed by Her
Majesty to an ensigncy in the Eighteenth, Royal Irish,
regiment of foot, on the 8th of May, 1846.</p>

<p>The details of the campaign on the Sutlej afford
abundant proofs of the skill and bravery of the troops:
the highest praise is due, and has been rendered
by their admiring and grateful countrymen, to the
officers and soldiers by whose gallantry four battles
were fought, and victories obtained, in sixty days,
over an enemy who had most ample means of equipping
and supplying his corps with all the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">matériel</i> of
war, and of choosing his own time and opportunity of
commencing his perfidious attack.</p>

<p>The army of the Sikhs, at the commencement of this
unprovoked aggression, is ascertained to have amounted
to 60,000 men, and their artillery to 108 pieces of
cannon, some of them being of large calibre.</p>

<p>The Anglo-Indian forces, which had been hastily
collected to contend against this immense army,
amounted only to about 20,000 men, a great proportion
of which had marched one hundred and sixty miles,
in order to arrive at the seat of war.</p>

<p>Under the most serious disadvantages, fatigues, and
privations, the British troops, with the aid of their
faithful allies, the Native corps, nobly contended with
their Sikh adversaries, “who, in spite of their exceeding
numbers and advantageous positions, were vanquished
in every battle.”</p>

<p>In expressing admiration of the heroic conduct of
the British troops in this short but decisive war, it is
the duty of the nation to acknowledge, with gratitude,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
the wonderful interference of a Supreme Power,
by whose all-wise decree the army of the Sikhs was
destroyed and dispersed; and, notwithstanding its
numbers, received a complete and signal overthrow, as
a just but severe punishment for its faithless conduct
and daring violation of every honorable and religious
feeling.</p>

<p>When it is considered that with a disparity of
force of three to one, independent of artillery, the
Sikh army was discomfited, and the enemy was driven
back to his capital to seek for safety and peace,
the British Nation must be sensible that an over-ruling
Power aided their cause, and gave strength where
numbers were deficient; and that another signal instance
of Divine favour and protection has been added to the
numerous claims which demand the nation’s humble
acknowledgment and gratitude.</p>

<p>The campaign on the Sutlej having terminated by
the destruction of the Sikh army and the capture of the
city of Lahore, a treaty of peace was entered into. The
Sikh government requested that a force of 10,000
British troops might be left at their capital for the
protection of the city and the maintenance of good
order: this being complied with, arrangements were
made for the return of the British army to the territories
of the East India Company.</p>

<p>The glorious news of the Battle of Sobraon was
received in London on the 1st of April, and was announced
to the British public by a royal salute from
the guns of the Tower and in St. James’s Park; and
the royal standard was displayed at Buckingham Palace
and at the Tower of London. The greatest sensation
pervaded all ranks of society: no military event, with
the exception of the Battle of Waterloo, excited such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
wonder and surprise, mingled with joy, that the cloud,
which had hung over the fate of the British Empire in
India, was completely dissipated by this last splendid
and decisive victory, which effected the final overthrow
of the power of the Sikhs, the destruction of their
army, and the capture of their artillery, on the sanguinary
field of <em>Sobraon</em>.</p>

<p>On the 2nd of April the Thanks of the House of
Lords were proposed by the Earl of Ripon, and carried

<p>After a tedious voyage down the Ganges, owing to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
shallowness of the river and the numerous sand-banks,
the regiment did not reach the station of Chinsurah
until the 6th of July, on which day it landed and
marched into barracks. Chinsurah, formerly a Dutch
settlement, was ceded by Holland to the British
Government in 1827; it is situated on the right bank
of the Ganges, about thirty miles from Calcutta: the
East India Company have built an excellent barrack
here for a regiment of infantry. The regiment was
halted here until the necessary preparations were made
for its embarkation for England.</p>

<p>On the 30th of July the arms of the regiment, which

of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment hung in tatters under
the principal canopy, blood-stained in the recent
engagements, in all of which the gallant regiment
was present. At the opposite end of the table was a
large transparency of the battle of Sobraon. Colonel
Warren presided at the supper-table; and Colonel
Burlton, in an excellent speech, reviewing the services
of the regiments from the commencement of the
present century, gave the toast of the evening, which
was acknowledged by Lieut.-Colonel MacDowell and
Lieut.-Colonel Spence.”</p>
</div>

<p>Previous to the departure of the regiment from
India, the following General Order was issued by
General Lord Gough, the Commander-in-Chief:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="fs80 right">“Head-Quarters, Simla, 23rd May, 1846.<br /></p>

<p>“Those distinguished regiments, the sixteenth
lancers and the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> foot, are about to
return to their native country after a service in
India, the former of twenty-four, the latter of twenty-one
years; and although the Commander-in-Chief has
recently, and so frequently, had occasion to laud the
gallant conduct of these corps before an intrepid
enemy, he cannot permit them to embark without
again expressing his admiration of their continued
and conspicuous bravery in all the battles they have
been engaged in during the long and eventful period<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
of their Indian service, whether in Affghanistan, or at
the more sanguinary conflicts of 1845 and 1846.</p>

<p>“These brave regiments may be assured they will
be received in their native land with every demonstration
of that patriotic feeling which gallant
exploits ensure from their countrymen.</p>

<p>“The sixteenth lancers have added to their standards
‘Bhurtpore, Affghanistan, Ghuznee, Maharajpore,
Aliwal, and Sobraon;’ and the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment
will have recorded on their already highly decorated
colours&mdash;‘Cabool, Moodkee, Ferozeshah, Aliwal,
and Sobraon.’</p>

<p>“Again must Lord Gough express the gratification
it affords him thus to be able to record his opinion of
their merits; and both these corps are assured that
their correct conduct in quarters, and almost total
absence of crime for many years, have mainly conduced
to the gallant achievements in the field to which their
good fortune has afforded them the opportunity to
contribute.</p>

<p>“That every happiness and welfare may hereafter
attend these regiments, is the Commander-in-Chief’s
ardent desire, for he must ever feel the warmest
interest in the career of such highly distinguished
regiments.</p>

<p>“The Commander-in-Chief congratulates the two
officers, Lieut.-Colonel MacDowell, C.B., and Lieut.-Colonel
Spence, who accompanied their regiments to
India nearly a quarter of a century ago, upon now
having the honor and gratification of commanding
them, after such distinguished services, on their return
to their native land. Lieut.-Colonel MacDowell has
never left India since his first arrival.</p>

</div>

<p>The regiment embarked for England, the left wing
under the command of Lieutenant Plaskett, on board
the ‘Plantagenet,’ on the 2nd of August, 1846, consisting
of 5 officers, 12 serjeants, 4 drummers, and 102
rank and file, 10 women and 10 children. The head-quarters,
or right wing, embarked on board the
‘Madagascar’ on the 3rd of August, 1846, under
the command of Major Staunton, and consisted of 10
officers, 19 serjeants, 7 drummers, and 194 rank and
file, 21 women, and 32 children. Unfortunately, as
the ‘Plantagenet’ was putting out to sea, she sprung
a leak, and was obliged to return to Calcutta with all
speed, the pumps being worked night and day by the
soldiers, without whose assistance she must have gone
down: they succeeded in bringing her safe into dock,
there being then above seven feet of water in the hold.
This detachment again embarked in the same ship on
the 29th of August, and arrived in England on the
13th of January, 1847, having lost on the passage seven
men. The ‘Madagascar,’ with head-quarters, arrived
in England on the 5th of December, and lost on the
passage Lieutenant Richard Sparrow and five soldiers.</p>

<p>After a voyage of four months, the surviving veterans
of the regiment were gladdened with the sight of the
shores of their native land. The head-quarters of the
regiment reached Gravesend on the 4th of December,
1846; and on the 6th disembarked and marched to
Chatham. Nothing could exceed the enthusiasm of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
the public to welcome the arrival of this distinguished
corps.</p>

<p>The following description of the reception the
regiment met with on its arrival, is taken from the
‘Illustrated London News’ of December, 1846:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<em>The Return of the</em> <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> <em>Regiment from
India</em>.&mdash;On the 4th instant the head-quarters of this
distinguished regiment arrived by the ship Madagascar
from Calcutta, from which place they embarked
on the 3rd of August last: they lost by deaths on the
voyage five men and one officer, Lieut. Richard
Sparrow. They brought home with them four captured
colours, which they took in the short but brilliant
campaign against the <span class="nowrap">Sikhs. * * *</span> On the evening
of the 6th the head-quarters marched into Chatham
garrison from Gravesend, by the Rochester and
Gravesend Railway, where they were met by the very
superior band of the royal marines. On the arrival at
the Rochester terminus, the band struck up, ‘God save
the Queen,’ and these heroes of the Sutlej were greeted
by hundreds of people with loud and repeated huzzas.
The soldiers, in return for this spirited welcome, waved
the four colours captured from the enemy, one at
Ferozeshah, one at Aliwal, and two taken at Sobraon.
These banners bear testimony of the severe engagements.
The Queen’s colour, and the regimental
colour, are complete fragments. The head-quarters
were also accompanied by the depôt band, which
played at intervals in passing with the regiment
through the streets of Rochester and Chatham, and
were greeted along the whole line by thousands of
people who assembled to witness their return.</p>

<p>“Out of the 215 men landed from the Madagascar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
there are but 80 unwounded. Lieut.-Colonel Spence,
and Quarter-master Benison, are the only officers,
now with the regiment, who went out with it in the
‘Kent’ East Indiaman, which took fire and sank in
the Bay of Biscay.</p>

<p>“The following officers have come home with the
head-quarters:&mdash;Major George Staunton, Brevet Major
D. F. G. Longworth, Lieut. G. Elmslie, Lieut.
T. Scarman, Lieut. R. Mackenzie, Lieut. and Adjutant
A. S. Bolton, Lieut. H. P. Hutton, Quarter-master
S. Benison, and Assistant-Surgeon H. C. Foss.
Total nine officers and 215 serjeants, drummers,
and rank and file.</p>

<p>“Lieut.-Colonel Spence headed the troops. The
officers of this regiment, having been on the most
friendly terms with the royal marine corps, and being
members of the mess of the royal marines, they dined
at the royal marines’ mess-room with the officers,
who invited them on their arrival at the garrison to
a superb repast.</p>

<p>“The officers of the regiment were invited to
dinner by Colonel Sir Frederick Smith and the
officers of the royal engineers in garrison at Chatham.
They also received invitations to dinner from the
officers of the 2nd battalion of the 60th rifles, and
also from the officers of the
provisional battalion
quartered in this garrison.”</p>
</div>

<p>Shortly after its arrival in England, the following
complimentary letter was received by Lieut.-Colonel
Spence, commanding the regiment, from that distinguished
officer General Sir Colin Halkett, G.C.B.,
the Colonel of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="fs80 right">“United Service Club, London, 22nd Dec., 1846.</p>

<p class="smcap noindent">“My Dear Colonel,</p>

<p>“It is with the liveliest satisfaction that I avail
myself of the arrival in England of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>
regiment, under your command, to offer you, and the
corps, my most sincere congratulations on your return
to your native land, after your arduous and distinguished
services in the East. Connected as I have the
honor to be with the regiment, it was natural for me
to take a deep interest in its welfare, and to follow its
fate and fortunes with all the attention in my power;
and as some professional experience enabled me to
appreciate the toils you had to encounter, and the
dangers you had to overcome, it was with highly
gratified pride and most heartfelt delight, that I heard
how nobly you had supported the first, and how gallantly
you had vanquished the latter.</p>

<p>“At the very outset of the voyage from England,
the regiment was already called upon to give proofs
of that high state of discipline, which is the soldier’s
best shield in difficulties. On dark and distant seas,
amid the flames of the unfortunate East India ship
Kent, you remained firm and tranquil, obedient to
orders issued by that meritorious soldier, your then
commanding officer, Lieut.-Colonel Fearon (now
Major-General), and thus ensured the safety of all
when every semblance of hope seemed to have
vanished, and when confusion must have led to
inevitable destruction.</p>

<p>“The promise, which such noble conduct gave, was
fully justified by your subsequent behaviour. Called
upon to aid in avenging disasters which the feebleness
of allies had brought upon your country’s arms, you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
forced your way through the most difficult part of
Central Asia, through mountain wildernesses unequalled
on the face of the globe, and never traversed
by disciplined troops since the days of the great Macedonian
conqueror. Even the gallantry, which you
displayed during this campaign, seems to be forgotten,
when we reflect on the steady discipline, and dauntless
energy, evinced in contending against the toils and
difficulties which had to be overcome at every step of
this memorable march, only eclipsed by the more
brilliant actions you were soon afterwards called upon
to perform.</p>

<p>“An Army, composed of the most warlike tribes of
Asia, trained to arms by European officers, long
accustomed to victory under the sway of an able and
ambitious prince, assuming, on the death of Runjeet
Singh, the power of absolute control over its feeble
government, resolved to invade the British provinces;
which, protected by a disciplined army, ruled by a wise
and paternal government, had long prospered in
peace, and acquired a degree of wealth too well
calculated to tempt the rapacity of such lawless
bands.</p>

<p>“To avoid every appearance of hostility, and preserve
peace to the last, the British authorities had kept
their forces at a distance from the frontier; and the
enemy thus emboldened by forbearance, which was
probably taken for timidity, crossed the Sutlej, and
attacked our possessions without even a declaration
of war. In this difficulty it was only by extraordinary
exertion on the part of the troops, by toil and
fortitude never surpassed, if ever equalled, that
your comrades posted along the frontier could be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
saved from ruin, and an unprincipled foe checked in
time to avert the greatest calamities.</p>

<p>“The march from Umballa must ever be memorable
in the annals of war. Under the burning sun of
India, you supported, at duty’s call, an excess of
toil and fatigue, which would have tried the hardiest
and the best, even in the bracing atmosphere of our
northern climate; and your victory of <em>Moodkee</em> was
actually achieved over bold, numerous, and well-prepared
foes, after a march of twenty miles, performed
under the rays of a vertical sun, through a
waste and parched country, not affording even a
drop of water to allay the scorching thirst occasioned
by the clouds of dust raised from the burning soil;
fought, and won in fact, after an excess of toil that
would have overcome all but the first and foremost
soldiers of their time.</p>

<p>“A single defeat was not, however, to daunt the
fierce and numerous foes with whom you had
to contend; and hardly had you recovered from
the fatigues of your long march and first victory,
when you were called upon to storm an entrenched
camp, defended by vastly superior numbers, and by a
train of heavy and well-served artillery such as the
East had never beheld. To assail works, under such
circumstances, is one of the most trying and difficult
operations of war; and when the strength of the
position, and the fierce resolution with which it was
defended, are considered, your victory may safely be
termed an action of unsurpassed boldness, energy,
and perseverance.</p>

<p>“Never will your country’s banner suffer a stain,
so long as its soldiers shall equal those who stormed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
the Sikh camp of <em>Ferozeshah</em>: greater fortitude and
gallantry than those of which you had given proof
in these actions could not possibly be displayed.
But every species of high soldiership was to be called
for during the course of this brief campaign, and it
was your fortune to be present in the different actions,
all fought under different circumstances.</p>

<p>“At <em>Aliwal</em> you had to execute on an open and
level plain, and under a heavy fire of artillery, the
skilful movements which ensured the success of that
brilliant day; and at <em>Sobraon</em> you were again called
upon to force entrenchments, constructed with European
science, and defended with all the fierce resolution
of Asiatic despair. But neither savage valour,
nor European art, could withstand your efforts,&mdash;could
compete with high and matchless gallantry,
regulated by discipline, and fired to noble exertion
by the consciousness of what was due to your
country’s name and fame!&mdash;The <em>Battle of Sobraon</em>,
which crushed the power of unprincipled adversaries,
terminated your exploits in the East, saved the
British provinces from devastation, and secured to
our youthful and beloved Sovereign the peaceful and
happy possession of India! Never indeed were nobler
objects attained by nobler conduct!</p>

<p>“It is needless for me to tell you how greatly all
ranks of your countrymen sympathised with your
fortunes during these trying times; how much they
felt for your sufferings; how deeply they mourned
for the heavy losses you sustained; and how highly
they exulted in the gallantry you displayed. The admiration
your behaviour excited, must have reached
you even on the distant shores of India; and I feel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
confident that every step you take on British ground
will show how justly your conduct is appreciated by
all those whose good opinion can be of value. It
only remains for me, therefore, again to offer you my
most sincere congratulations on your return to your
native land, to wish you every success and happiness
in your future progress, and to assure you, that as
far as my sphere of action extends, no effort shall be
wanting to give effect to the sentiments I feel such
high satisfaction in now expressing.</p>

<p>As an additional testimony of the consideration of
the services of the officers and men of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>
regiment who had returned from India, His Grace
the Commander-in-Chief was pleased to authorize the
following letter to be addressed to the officer commanding,
dated Horse Guards, 21st of December, 1846:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">“Sir,</p>

<p>“In transmitting the enclosed Copy of the General
Order of the 30th of October last, granting leave of
absence to officers, and furloughs to non-commissioned
officers and men, to the 10th of March next, I
have it in command to intimate to you, that the
Commander-in-Chief, duly considering the glorious
and important services recently performed by the
regiment under your command, as well as its protracted
service abroad, has been pleased to direct<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
that furloughs may be forthwith granted to such of
the non-commissioned officers and men recently returned
from India, without limitation as to numbers,
as may be desirous of availing themselves of that
indulgence, so as to enable them immediately to visit
their friends; and that leave of absence may, in like
manner, be extended to as large a portion of the
officers as can be spared from the duties of the
regiment.</p>

<p class="right">

<span class="padr2">(<em>Signed</em>) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; “<span class="smcap">John Macdonald</span>,</span><br />
“<em>Adjutant-General</em>.”<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>The usual directions were given by the Secretary
at War for reducing the establishment of the regiment,
in order to assimilate it to that of other regiments
on home duty, from the 6th of December, 1846.</p>

<p>After transferring to the Invalid Depôt the men
selected for discharge on account of wounds and other
disabilities, and incorporating the depôt with the other
companies, the regiment was removed from Chatham
to Walmer, where it arrived on the 20th of December,
and was received at Deal and in the neighbouring
parts, with the same honors and marks of distinction
as had been evinced on its arrival in the garrison of
Chatham.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1847</div>

<p>The remainder of the regiment, consisting of five
officers, viz., Lieutenants Plaskett, Law, Pilkington,
and Noel, Assistant-Surgeon Massey, and 111 men,
arrived at Gravesend on the 13th of January, 1847,
on board of the Plantagenet freight ship: the delay in
their arrival was occasioned by that vessel having
sprung a leak, which compelled her to put back to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
Calcutta. This division proceeded from Chatham on
the 20th of January, to join the head-quarters of the
regiment at Walmer.</p>

<p>On the 30th of June, 1847, the regiment was apprised
by the Adjutant-General, that her Majesty had
been pleased to approve of its bearing on the regimental
colour and appointments the words <span class="smcap">Moodkee</span>,
<span class="smcap">Ferozeshah</span>, <span class="smcap">Aliwal</span>, and <span class="smcap">Sobraon</span>, in commemoration
of the distinguished conduct evinced by the
<span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> at those battles.</p>

<p>Lieut.-General the Honorable Henry Otway Trevor
was appointed to the colonelcy of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>
regiment on the 12th of July, 1847, in succession to
General Sir Colin Halkett, G.C.B., who was removed
to the forty-fifth regiment.</p>

<p>On the 6th of September, 1847, Lieut.-General
Sir Henry Smith came to Walmer to see the regiment,
before he proceeded to the Cape of Good Hope, of
which colony he had been appointed Governor and
Commander-in-Chief. On the 7th of September he
reviewed the regiment, and expressed his satisfaction
at seeing its discipline so perfect, considering that only
a few months had elapsed since it returned home a
mere skeleton.</p>

<p>The regiment was inspected by Major-General
Brown on the 4th of May, and on the 1st of October,
1847; it was inspected on the 10th of November, by
His Grace the Duke of Wellington, <ins class="corr" id="tn-183" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'who expressed hi '">
who expressed his</ins> approbation in the highest terms. In November the
regiment was removed to Manchester by railway in
three divisions, where it was completed to its establishment
of 39 officers, 47 serjeants, 40 corporals, 17
drummers, and 760 privates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1848</div>

<p>On the 7th of April, 1848, the regiment proceeded
to Ireland, and arrived at Dublin on the following day.
In July the regiment marched to Athlone.</p>

<p>New Colours were presented to the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>
regiment, on the 19th of May, 1848, by Major-General
His Royal Highness the Prince George of Cambridge,
K.G., and the following account of the ceremony was
given in “<cite>Saunders’ News-Letter</cite>” of the following
day:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The interesting military ceremonial of the presentation
of New Colours to this gallant and distinguished
corps took place yesterday, in the ornamental
grounds in front of that fine building, the Queen’s
Inns, Henrietta-street, Dublin. The regiment was
formed in full review order at three o’clock, shortly
after which His Royal Highness Prince George of
Cambridge, accompanied by his aide-de-camp Captain
the Honorable James Macdonald, Major-General
John M‘Donald, and several other officers of distinction,
came upon the ground.</p>

<p>“In front of the line were four standards, captured
by the regiment from the Sikhs, one of them taken
at <em>Ferozeshah</em>, one at <em>Aliwal</em>, and two at <em>Sobraon</em>.
The Colours of the Corps, torn to pieces from the
grape-shot through which they were led to victory,
and stained with the blood of the Ensigns who were
killed carrying them to the muzzles of the Sikh guns,
were objects of great interest to the numerous citizens
who thronged the grounds. Lieut.-Colonel Spence,
C.B., who commanded the gallant regiment in all
these actions, except Sobraon (where he commanded
the first brigade of Sir Henry Smith’s Division), was in
command, and looked in admirable health and spirits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span></p>

<p>“The survivors of the Indian campaigns were decorated
with their medals. After the usual routine of
parading the old colours, and giving them up, the
band playing ‘<em>Auld lang syne</em>,’ the Regiment formed
a hollow square, and the Garrison Chaplain repeated
the prescribed formula for the occasion. The New
Colours were then handed to Ensigns Christian and
Brown, when His Royal Highness the Prince George
of Cambridge briefly addressed the Regiment, stating
his gratification at having this pleasing duty to perform.
He had not seen service himself, and the
task would have fallen more appropriately upon one
who had. In encouraging the troops to the performance
of their duty, he related the anecdote of the
Serjeant who, when the Ensign bearing the old
colour had fallen mortally wounded, seized it,&mdash;carried
it onwards,&mdash;and victory resulted. The non-commissioned
officer was promoted to an ensigncy in the
Eighteenth, Royal Irish, regiment.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>“The corps then formed in line, and gave a Royal
salute, the band playing ‘<em>God save the Queen</em>.’ The
day was remarkably fine, and after the ceremony the
regiment marched into its quarters in the Linen-Hall
Barracks.”</p>
</div>

<p>Certain of the distinguished officers of the garrison
of Dublin were entertained by the officers of the regiment
at dinner in the evening; but His Royal Highness
Prince George was prevented from attending by
an expected disturbance in the city.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1849</div>

<p>On the 1st of February, 1849, the establishment of
the regiment was reduced from eight hundred to seven
hundred and fifty rank and file.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span></p>

<p>On the 20th of July, 1849, Lieut.-Colonel Spence
retired, after a lengthened service of forty-one years,
and Major George Staunton was promoted to the rank
of Lieut.-Colonel of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment, in
succession to Lieut.-Colonel James Spence.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>During the year 1849 the regiment remained at
Athlone.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1850</div>

<p>In April, 1850, the regiment proceeded from Athlone
to Dublin, where it continued to be stationed at the
conclusion of the Historical Record.</p>

Spain, is about thirty miles in length and twelve in breadth, and is chiefly
valuable for the excellent harbour of Port Mahon. In September, 1708,
Minorca was taken by Admiral Leake and a land force under Lieut.-General
Stanhope, after a siege of about three weeks. The island was
ceded to Great Britain by the treaty of Utrecht, and remained in
its possession until 1756, when, in April of that year, it was besieged by
the French, under Marshal the Duke de Richelieu. After a brave defence
by the Governor, General Blakeney, the garrison, consisting of the
4th, 23rd, 24th, and 34th regiments, surrendered, and, in consideration
of their gallantry, were permitted to march out with all the honors of
war. At the peace of Fontainebleau, in 1763, Minorca was restored
to the English in exchange for Belle-Isle. In February, 1782, the
garrison, under the Governor, Lieut.-General the Honorable James
Murray, after suffering severely from sickness, surrendered to the Duke
de Crillon, the Commander-in-Chief of the combined French and
Spanish forces, and Minorca was retained by Spain at the peace of
1783. Minorca again surrendered to a British force under General the
Honorable Charles Stuart, on the 15th of November, 1798; and at the
peace of Amiens, in 1802, Minorca was restored to the Spaniards, under
whose sway it remains at the present period.</p>

the 10th June, 1688. He married, in 1719, Mary Clementina, daughter
of Prince James Sobieski, and granddaughter of John Sobieski, King of
Poland. He died on the 1st June, 1766 (aged 78 years), leaving issue
two sons:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <em>Charles Edward Louis Cassimir</em>, termed in England “<em>The Young
Pretender</em>;” born on the 30th November, 1720, who married the Princess
Stohlberg of Germany, and died at Rome, without issue, on the 31st
January, 1788.</p>

<p>2. <em>Henry Benedict</em>, called <em>The Cardinal York</em>; born on the 24th
March, 1725. When the last grand effort for the restoration of his family,
in 1745, proved abortive, he took holy orders, and was elevated to the
Purple by Pope Benedict XIV. in 1747, and died at Rome in 1807. The

<p><a id="Footnote_11" href="#FNanchor_11" class="label">[11]</a> From the signing of the Treaty of Utrecht, in April, 1718, until
1739, the only events that appeared at times to threaten the <em>general</em>
tranquillity of Europe which prevailed during the above period, arose
from the Rebellion in Scotland, in favour of the Pretender, in 1715,
which was suppressed by the Battle of <em>Sheriffmuir</em>, on the 13th of November
of that year. Charles XII., of Sweden, also espoused the cause
of the Pretender in 1717, but the death of King Charles, in the following
year, put an end to the projected expedition to Great Britain. In 1719
Spain supported the Pretender with troops, which were, however, defeated
at <em>Glenshiel</em>, on the 10th of June, 1719. This was followed by the
British expedition against Spain, but in January, 1720, the Spanish
Monarch accepted the conditions of Peace. In 1726 Spain made an
unsuccessful attempt to recover <em>Gibraltar</em>, and in 1729 a treaty of Peace
was concluded at Seville, which remained unbroken for the ten following
years.</p>

facings and breeches of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> being of the same colour as

<p><a id="Footnote_15" href="#FNanchor_15" class="label">[15]</a> Although the results of the <em>Battle of Dettingen</em>, fought on the 27th
of June, 1743, were not equal to those attending the victories gained
over the French by Edward the Third and Henry the Fifth, yet there are
circumstances which render the conflict at <em>Dettingen</em> similar to those of
<em>Creçy</em> and <em>Agincourt</em>. At <em>Creçy</em>, on the 26th of August, 1346, King
<em>Edward the Third</em> and his son <em>Edward the Black Prince</em> were present;
and at <em>Dettingen</em>, <em>King George the Second</em> was accompanied by his son the
<em>Duke of Cumberland</em>. It was the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">début</i> of both the Royal Princes on the
tented plain, and the chivalrous bearing of the <em>Black Prince</em>, particularly
his behaviour to the prisoners, finds a parallel in the conduct of the <em>Duke
of Cumberland</em>, who refused to have his wound attended to, until the
surgeons had examined that of a French officer, the Count De Fenelon,
who had been taken prisoner and conveyed to the Duke’s tent. “Begin,”
said His Royal Highness, “with the wound of the French officer; he is
more dangerously hurt than I am, and stands more in need of assistance.”</p>

<p>The disadvantage under which the British fought at <em>Dettingen</em> was
equal to that at <em>Agincourt</em>, and the impetuosity of the enemy, in both
instances, prevented the English army perishing from want of provisions.</p>

<p>All these battles are likewise noted for the number of the French
Royal family and nobility who were present; and the battle of Dettingen
is further remarkable as being the last action in which a British Monarch
commanded the army.</p>

<p>The want of provisions and tents, unfortunately, compelled the victors
to abandon the field of battle, otherwise Dettingen might have rivalled
many of the achievements recorded in British History.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_24" href="#FNanchor_24" class="label">[24]</a> While stationed at Jersey, a soldier of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment
displayed the following example of courage and presence of mind:&mdash;On
the 4th of June, 1804, a salute had been fired in honor of the anniversary
of the birthday of King George III. The bombardier, whose
duty it was to deposit the slow match in the magazine on the Town Hill
at St. Heliers, after the performance of the ceremony, neglected to observe
whether it was extinguished; it unfortunately was still alight, and set
fire to the building; there were within the place three hundred and
twenty-five barrels of powder, and, from its central situation, an explosion
would have destroyed the greater portion of the town. Private
William Pentenny, of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment, assisted by two
inhabitants of Jersey, broke open the magazine, when another moment’s
delay would probably have been too late, the fire having nearly reached
the spot where the powder was deposited, when he entered. With
infinite coolness and decision, he carried the nearest barrels away in his
arms, and continued so to act until the whole stock was removed out of
danger. This important service was highly appreciated. The Patriotic
Fund at Lloyd’s awarded Private William Pentenny a pension of 20<em>l.</em>
a year, while the states of Jersey conferred an additional 12<em>l.</em> upon this
deserving soldier, and presented to him a gold medal, struck on purpose
to commemorate the achievement, which he was permitted to wear.
The Governor, Major-General the Honorable William Stewart, ordered
a ring of silver lace to be worn round his arm as a further distinction.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_26" href="#FNanchor_26" class="label">[26]</a> General Avitabile, one of the military instructors of the Sikhs, was
a native of Italy, and at the conclusion of Napoleon’s bright, but
evanescent career, sought employment in the East. He was handsomely
rewarded by the Sovereign of the Punjaub, Runjeet Singh, together
with another Italian officer, named Ventura, and two Frenchmen,
Allard and Court, for introducing European tactics into the Sikh army.
Runjeet Singh also conferred the governorship of Peshawur upon
General Avitabile, and by his vigorous administration it was reduced
from a state of anarchy to one of comparative security. Peshawur signifies
“<em>advanced post</em>,” that name having been conferred upon it by its
founder, the Mogul Emperor Akbar, in consequence of its being the
frontier town of India towards Affghanistan.</p>

<p>Runjeet Singh died in 1839, and his son and successor, Kurruck Singh,
being of weak intellect, was shortly afterwards deposed, when his son,
Noo Nehal Singh, assumed the reins of Government. His death, which
occurred in returning from his father’s funeral, caused the throne to be
again vacant, and the crown was bestowed on Prince Shere Singh, a twin-son
of Runjeet Singh. Shere Singh was a firm friend to the English, and
by his interference Major-General Pollock was permitted to proceed with
his army through the Punjaub to Cabool in 1842, although the Sikh
Sirdars were disposed to attack the British troops.</p>

<p class="p1 noindent">Napoleon Bonaparte, upon being raised in May 1804
to the dignity of Emperor of the French, increased
his immense preparations to carry into effect his project
for the invasion of England, that he might, by one
great effort, crush the power of the British people, who
appeared as a barrier to his ambitious designs. This
menace of invasion had aroused the spirit of the British
nation; patriotic enthusiasm pervaded all ranks; and
among the measures of defence<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> adopted by the Government
was the introduction of the “<em>Additional Force
Act</em>” which was passed on the 14th of July 1804.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1805</div>

<p>Under this Act of Parliament, a <em>second battalion</em> was
added to the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment, which was to be
formed of men raised in the county of Chester for
limited service.</p>

<p>The second battalion was embodied by July 1805,
and in October it proceeded from Chester to Winchester,
where the first battalion was stationed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1806</div>

<p>After the first battalion had embarked for Sicily in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
April 1806, the second battalion continued at Winchester
until June following, when it proceeded to
Gosport.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1807</div>

<p>On the 8th of January 1807, the second battalion
embarked at Gosport for Guernsey, where it arrived
on the 15th of that month. In May 1807, the battalion
proceeded to Ireland, and was stationed at Limerick.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1808</div>

<p>In March 1808, the battalion was removed from
Limerick to Dublin.</p>

<p>Important events had in the meantime occurred on
the Continent, which occasioned the second battalion
of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment to be ordered on active
service. Napoleon, having reduced Germany to submission
to his will, and forced Russia to accede to his
decrees, next attempted the subjugation of Spain and
Portugal. The Spaniards and Portuguese rose in arms
to assert their national rights, the French Emperor
having conferred the crown of Spain on his brother
Joseph, who relinquished the throne of Naples in favor
of Marshal Murat.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1808, Portugal was delivered by a
British army under Lieut.-General Sir Arthur Wellesley;
and in the autumn Lieut.-General Sir John
Moore received orders to advance with a body of British
troops from Portugal into the heart of Spain; at
the same time several regiments were embarked from
the United Kingdom to co-operate in the enterprise.</p>

<p>The second battalion of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>, which
had proceeded in August to Fermoy, marched on the
8th of September to Monkstown for embarkation, and
sailed in a few days afterwards to Falmouth, where a
fleet was assembling with a force for service, the command
of the troops being held by Lieut.-General Sir
David Baird. In a short time, the fleet sailed, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
arrived in the Bay of Corunna on the 23rd of October.
The <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> did not, however, land with the
army, the battalion being despatched to Lisbon, where
it arrived on the 5th of November.</p>

<p>Lieut.-General Sir John Cradock, who commanded
in Portugal at this period, detached some regiments
towards the frontier, with a view of reinforcing Lieut.-General
Sir John Moore in Spain. The <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>,
being one of the corps destined for this service,
marched with a force under the command of Brigadier-General
Richard Stewart from Lisbon, on the 18th of
December, upon Castello Branco, where the battalion
arrived in ten days.</p>

<p>The communication with Lieut.-General Sir John
Moore being at this period suddenly interrupted, Brigadier-General
Stewart was ordered to halt, and unfavourable
intelligence being received from Spain, Lieut.-General
Sir John Cradock determined to concentrate
his army near Lisbon, and the further advance was,
therefore, countermanded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1809</div>

<p>The second battalion of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>, and the
other corps of the division, commenced their march to
the rear on the 1st of January 1809. On arrival at
Santarem, the intelligence of Sir John Moore’s advance
upon Sahagun had reached head-quarters, and the anticipated
danger being thus drawn from the frontiers
of Portugal, Brigadier-General Stewart was again ordered
to halt. His head-quarters continued at Santarem,
and the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> occupied cantonments in
the neighbourhood of Bucellas. A month’s march in
incessant rain had seriously damaged the appointments,
and the men being indifferently provided with shoes,
rendered a rest in this pleasant quarter of infinite
benefit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span></p>

<p>In the meanwhile, the army under Lieut.-General
Sir John Moore had continued its retreat over two
hundred and fifty miles of mountainous country, constantly
repulsing the attacks of the enemy. The British
army arrived at Corunna on the 11th of January,
being closely followed by Marshal Soult, who occupied a
position on a height above the town, in order to make
an attack on the troops while proceeding to embark.
This operation commenced on the 16th of January, and
the French descending from the heights in three columns,
a sanguinary action ensued. Lieut.-General
Sir John Moore received a mortal wound from a cannon-ball,
and his country was deprived of an officer,
who, both in his professional and private character, had
acquired universal esteem and admiration. Lieut.-General
Sir David Baird lost an arm, and the command
devolved on Lieut.-General Sir John Hope, who
vigorously maintained the action, the British remaining
masters of the field. The embarkation for England
was effected on the following night, no further molestation
being offered by the enemy.</p>

<p>No change was made in the disposition of the army
in Portugal until the middle of March, when Lieut.-General
Sherbrooke, and Major-General John Randoll
McKenzie, with their corps arrived. The army was
then drawn together between Lumiar and Sacavem,
in which position it encamped until toward the end of
April, when Lieut.-General Sir John Cradock commenced
his advance towards Spain on the 24th of that month;
and when Lieut.-General Sir Arthur Wellesley, who
had arrived at Lisbon with reinforcements, assumed the
command of the army, the force was assembled at
Leiria. The first object of Lieut.-General Sir Arthur
Wellesley was to dislodge Marshal Soult from Oporto,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
and he accordingly marched towards that city at the
end of April.</p>

<p>A corps of British and Portuguese was detached,
previous to Sir Arthur Wellesley’s march upon Oporto,
under Major-General McKenzie, to watch the right
bank of the Tagus in observation of Marshal Victor in
Estremadura. The second battalion of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>
joined this army, and remained posted at Thomar
until after the famous passage of the Douro by the
British General, and the fall of Oporto, which compelled
Marshal Soult to retreat.</p>

<p>In the month of June the second battalion of the
<span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> was at Cortiçada with Major-General
McKenzie’s head-quarters, and in that officer’s division
reached Placentia, whence on the 17th of July
it commenced its march to Oropesa, where it arrived
on the 20th. A junction with the Spanish army under
General Cuesta was effected here, and on the 22nd the
advanced guards, to which the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> belonged,
moved forward to the attack on the French posts at
<em>Talavera</em>. The enemy’s position was turned by the
British cavalry and infantry, while the Spanish General
drove the French on in front. On the 25th, in consequence
of General Cuesta having followed the enemy,
two divisions of infantry were sent across the Alberche
to Casa Legas. The second battalion of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>
was in that commanded by Major-General
McKenzie, and was brigaded with the twenty-eighth
and forty-fifth regiments.</p>

<p>On the 27th of July, when General Cuesta had retreated
from Alcabon under cover of Lieut.-General
Sherbrooke’s divisions, Lieut.-General Sir Arthur Wellesley
withdrew to the position of <em>Talavera</em>, leaving<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
Major-General McKenzie on the Alberche to protect
the movement. When the French, on the 27th of July,
crossed this river, Major-General McKenzie’s division
was posted near the Casa des Salinas, his infantry in
the forest, and cavalry on the plain.</p>

<p>The attach was somewhat sudden, and the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>
and eighty-seventh regiments, which were in the
wood on the right of the Alberche, sustained some loss.
As the enemy increased his numbers on the British
side of the river, Major-General McKenzie fell back
gradually, and entering the position by the left of the
combined army, took up his ground in a second line,
in rear of the foot guards. In the dusk of the evening
the enemy commenced his attack on the British left, but
failed; in the night the attack was repeated, and on
the morning of the 28th of July the French renewed
the attack on the height on the British left, and were
again repulsed with considerable loss. After a pause
of some hours the attacks were renewed upon the whole
British front, and the action became general. Brigadier-General
Alexander Campbell’s division, on the British
right, sustained the assault of the enemy’s fourth corps,
assisted by Major-General McKenzie’s brigade. “The
English regiments, putting the French skirmishers
aside, met the advancing columns with loud shouts,
and breaking in on their front, and lapping their
flanks with fire, and giving no respite, pushed them
back with a terrible carnage. Ten guns were taken;
but as General Campbell prudently forbore pursuit,
the French rallied on their supports, and made a show
of attacking again: vain attempt! The British artillery
and musketry played too vehemently upon
their masses, and a Spanish regiment of cavalry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
charging on their flank at the same time, the whole
retired in disorder, and the victory was secured in
that quarter.”<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>The ten captured guns remained in possession of the
British;&mdash;Major-General John Randoll McKenzie was
killed;&mdash;and the second battalion of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>
regiment, under Major John Williams Watson, conducted
itself in such a manner as to merit notice in the
despatch, as well as approbation in General Orders.
Major Watson received a medal, and was afterwards
promoted to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel for his
conduct on this occasion.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>, in the actions of the 27th and 28th
of July, had Captain William Lodge, two serjeants,
and forty-two rank and file <em>killed</em>; Captains Nicolls and
Coleman,&mdash;Lieutenants George Beamish, Adderley
Beamish, and Girdlestone,&mdash;Ensigns Gamble and
Soden,&mdash;Assistant-Surgeon Edwards,&mdash;eight serjeants,
and one hundred and eighty-two rank and file, <em>wounded</em>.
Most of the wounded fell into the hands of the French,
on the abandonment of Talavera afterwards by the
Spanish General. Assistant-Surgeon Edwards, who was
left in charge of the wounded, died shortly afterwards.</p>

<p>The news of the brilliant victory of <em>Talavera</em>, gained
over the French army commanded by Joseph Bonaparte
in person, excited great joy in England, and Lieut.-General
Sir Arthur Wellesley was raised to the peerage
by the title of Viscount Wellington. The Royal Authority
was afterwards given for the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> to
bear the word “<span class="smcap">Talavera</span>” on the Regimental Colour
and Appointments, to commemorate the distinguished
conduct of the second battalion on that memorable
occasion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span></p>

<p>After the battle of the 28th of July, the second
battalion was posted to Major-General Tilson’s brigade,
in the division commanded by Major-General Rowland
(afterwards Viscount) Hill; and on the 3rd of August
marched from Talavera, in order to oppose the French,
who had entered Estremadura by Placentia.</p>

<p>On the 3rd of September, the head-quarters arrived
at Badajoz, and the army was distributed about Elvas,
Campo Mayor, and other places, the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>
being in the division cantoned at Montejo. The troops
had suffered greatly on the march from Talavera, generally
from dysentery, brought on by bad food, fatigue,
and exposure. When the second battalion had rested
awhile in its position, the sickness that had been kept
off in a great measure by the previous excitement, now
visited the men severely, and a considerable number died.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1810</div>

<p>When Viscount Wellington broke up from the Guadiana
in the month of December, and crossed the Tagus,
he left Lieut.-General Hill, who had been appointed to
serve on the Staff in the Peninsula as a Lieut.-General,
after the battle of <em>Talavera</em>, with a force of ten thousand
men, British and Portuguese, at Abrantes. Among
the former was the second battalion of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>;
it continued at that place until February 1810, when
Lieut.-General Hill, on the approach of Marshal Mortier
on Badajoz, marched to Portalegre, and occupied
that strong position. He made a move on the 23rd of
April through the Sierra de St. Marmede, which had
the desired effect of relieving General O’Donnell at
Albuquerque, the enemy retiring to Merida. Lieut.-General
Hill was once more at Portalegre on the 26th
of April, and on the 15th of May he again quitted his
cantonment, by which movement he disengaged Badajoz
from the attention of the enemy, who had made a reconnoisance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
on the 12th of that place, and relieved
General Ballasteros, returning in a few days afterwards
to his old position.</p>

<p>During the continuance of the division at Portalegre,
it was always on the alert, owing to General Regnier’s
movements in Estremadura. In the beginning of July,
Lieut.-General Hill concentrated his corps at Campo
Mayor, previously to an expedition into Estremadura
in conjunction with the Marquis de Romana. General
Regnier had, however, frustrated this plan, by quitting
Merida on the 10th of July, and marching upon Aleonete
and Almaraz, effected the passage of the Tagus on the
16th. Lieut.-General Hill made a parallel movement,
and crossing the river at Vilha Velha, was at Castello
Branco on the 21st; he encamped at Sarzedas, in front
of the Sobreira Formosa, remaining some time in observation
between the Estrella and the Tagus.</p>

<p>Upon Marshal Massena concentrating his force for
the invasion of Portugal, Lieut.-General Hill fell back
from his position at Sarzedas, and on the 21 st of August,
arrived on the Alva. On the 26th, the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>
in Lieut.-General Hill’s corps, crossed the Mondego,
arrived on the <em>Sierra de Busaco</em>, and was posted on
the right, across the road leading over the mountain
ridge to Peña Cova, but the battalion was not engaged
in the action.</p>

<p>When General Regnier attacked the position held
by the third and fifth divisions, Lieut.-General Hill
withdrew towards his left to support them; it was unnecessary
however, these divisions having repulsed the
enemy, and he therefore continued in his original
position.</p>

<p>After the battle of Busaco, fought on the 27th of
September, the army withdrew from the Sierra, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
Lieut.-General Hill’s division marched on Thomar,
arriving there on the 4th of October; whence continuing
its retreat by Santarem, it took up its ground, on the
8th, on the right of the Torres Vedras lines at Alhandra,
on the right of the Tagus, in which position the second
battalion of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> had several skirmishes
with the enemy, without sustaining much loss. The
battalion remained at Alhandra, opposite which was
the second French corps under General Regnier.</p>

<p>On the 17th of November, the second division crossed
the Tagus at Villada upon Abrantes, where the French
were in retreat. Upon Marshal Massena taking up a
position at Santarem, it halted at Chamako, where the
head-quarters were stationed; the troops being so distributed
as to have an eye to the enemy, and prevent
his crossing to the south of the Tagus. Lieut.-General
Hill returned to England on account of ill health in
December, and Marshal Sir William Carr (now Viscount)
Beresford succeeded him in the command of his
division, which amounted to fourteen thousand men,
British and Portuguese.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1811</div>

<p>The hostile armies remained in the same positions
until the beginning of March, when Marshal Massena
broke up from Santarem, and Major-General the Honorable
William Stewart, with a body of troops, of which
the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> formed part, crossed the Tagus at
Abrantes, and moved to Thomar, while Marshal Beresford
remained at Barla, and did not join in the pursuit
of Marshal Massena.</p>

<p>Towards the end of March, Sir William Beresford
arrived at Portalegre with twenty thousand infantry,
two thousand cavalry, and eighteen guns, with orders
to relieve Campo Mayor, and besiege <em>Olivenza</em> and
<em>Badajoz</em>. The first object was effected on the 25th of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
March; it was an affair of cavalry only. On the 6th
of April, the passage of the Guadiana took place at
Jurumenha, and the army occupied a position on a
strong range of hills. On the 9th of April, <em>Olivenza</em>
was summoned, and not surrendering the army encamped
round it. General Latour Maubourg having
retired to Llerena, Marshal Beresford leaving the fourth
division, with Colonel Madden’s cavalry, opposite
Olivenza, took post on the 11th at <em>Albuhera</em>, the infantry
being on the 16th drawn nearer to <em>Badajoz</em>, which place
was invested on the 8th of May.</p>

<p>On the 8th and 10th of May, the French made two
sorties, but were driven back with considerable loss.
Marshal Soult’s approach to relieve Badajoz having
been ascertained, the siege was raised on the night of
the 12th, and moving to <em>Albuhera</em>, the British were in
position on the 15th of May.</p>

<p>The second battalion of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> was on the
left of Lieut.-Colonel Colborne’s brigade, in the division
under Major-General the Honorable William Stewart,
which was drawn up, in one line, behind the village of
<em>Albuhera</em>; its right on a commanding hill, over which the
Valverde road passed; its left on the road to Badajoz.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 16th of May, the grand attack
was made by the French on the right of the position,
and in a line at right angles to it: this point was contested
by the Spaniards without success,&mdash;they gave
way, and the French columns pushing on, seized the
crown of the hill, and bringing up their reserves,
established their batteries in position on it. At this
moment Major-General the Honorable William Stewart
brought forward Lieut.-Colonel Colborne’s brigade,
and arrived with it at the foot of the hill, while all was
in confusion above. The Major-General rushed on in
open column of companies, attempting to form his line<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
in succession as the battalions arrived. The <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>,
the left of the brigade, was still in column, when
four regiments of hussars and lancers, which had been
concealed by the heavy rain falling at the time, passed
by the right flank to the rear of the line.</p>

<p>“<em>One battalion only</em> (<em>the</em> <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>) <em>being still in
column, escaped the storm, and maintained its ground,
while the French horsemen, riding violently over everything
else, penetrated to all parts.</em>”<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>Major-General the Honorable William Lumley sent
some squadrons of cavalry to take the attention of the
Lancers, but the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> continued to hold the
height, while the Spaniards would not advance, and
Marshal Soult still kept his columns together on the
point he had assailed. Major-General Hoghton’s
brigade coming up in good order, under Major-General
the Honorable William Stewart, and being soon afterwards
reinforced by a portion of the fourth division,
relieved the second battalion of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> from
the difficulty of its position.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> had two serjeants and twenty-six
rank and file <em>killed</em>; and Captains Fleming and Knox,
Lieutenants Butler, Gethen, and Bolton; Ensigns
Wilson and Nicholson; four serjeants, and one hundred
and sixteen rank and file, <em>wounded</em>.</p>

<p>Major George Guy Carleton L’Estrange, who commanded
the battalion, at the battle of <em>Albuhera</em>, was promoted
to the rank of Lieut.-Colonel in the army for
his conduct on that day, and received a medal. Viscount
Wellington alluded to his gallantry in the following
terms:&mdash;</p>

<p>“There is one officer, Major L’Estrange, of the
<span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>, whom I must recommend, in the strongest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
manner, for promotion in some way or other. <em>After
the other parts of the same brigade were swept off by the
Cavalry, this little battalion alone held its ground against
all the ‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">colonnes en masse</span>.’</em>”</p>

<p>Captain Peter Fearon, of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>, distinguished
himself on the same day in command of the
Lusitanian legion, and received a medal for his conduct.</p>

<p>The Royal Authority was afterwards given for the
<span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> to bear the word “<span class="smcap">Albuhera</span>” on the
regimental colour and appointments, to commemorate
the distinguished conduct of the second battalion on
that memorable occasion.</p>

<p>The army was again in position during the 17th of
May, the enemy appearing to meditate another attack;
the remainder of the fourth division, however, arrived
by forced marches from Jurumenha, and on the 18th
Marshal Soult retreated, followed by Marshal Beresford,
who left the Portuguese to make a show of investing
Badajoz. The infantry had no affair with the enemy
during his retreat; and when he assumed a position at
Llerena, the operations terminated.</p>

<p>Major-General Hill at this period rejoined from
England, and the second siege of <em>Badajoz</em> commenced
on the 30th of May.</p>

<p>The second battalion of the <span class="allsmcap"><ins class="corr" id="tn-199" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'THIRY-FIRST'">
THIRTY-FIRST</ins></span> continued
under Lieut.-General Hill, to which rank he was promoted
on the 4th of June 1811, in the covering army,
which was posted between Merida and Albuhera.
Having been much reduced in the late action, it was
formed, with the sixty-sixth regiment, into a Provisional
Battalion, under the command of Lieut.-Colonel Colborne.</p>

<p>When Marshal Soult advanced, and the siege of
Badajoz was raised, the covering army was once more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
concentrated on the position of Albuhera. The French
Marshal did not, however, attack; on the 17th of June,
the British crossed the Guadiana, and prepared for the
probability of an engagement with the united corps of
Marshals Marmont and Soult. In July, the British
were relieved from their presence, and the Commander-in-Chief,
Viscount Wellington, leaving Lieut.-General
Hill to watch Estremadura, at Portalegre, Villa
Viciosa, and Estremos, with ten thousand men, put the
rest of the army into quarters near the Tagus.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> continued with Lieut.-General
Hill in the second division: this part of the army was
constantly on the alert, but nothing very important
occurred until October.</p>

<p>On the 9th of October, Lieut.-General Hill’s force
was concentrated behind Campo Mayor, and on the 22nd
marched to drive Marshal Girard from Caçeres: at
daylight on the 28th of October, the British General
surprised the French Marshal at <em>Arroyo dos Molinos</em>, in
which brilliant affair the second battalion of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>
was present.</p>

<p>The army returned to its cantonments about Portalegre
immediately afterwards, and remained in them
until the 24th and 25th of December, when it moved
upon Merida, and arrived there on the 30th to surprise
General Dombrouski, and attack General Drouet. They
both retired, abandoning magazines of wheat, and Lieut.-General
Hill took up his cantonments at Merida on the
6th of January, 1812.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1812</div>

<p>Immediately afterwards Lieut.-General Hill fell
back upon the frontiers of Portugal, while the grand
army was investing <em>Ciudad Rodrigo</em>, and occupied
Portalegre.</p>

<p>In March, <em>Badajoz</em> was invested for the third time, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
Lieut.-General Sir Rowland Hill’s<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> corps again formed
part of the covering army. He halted at Almendralejos,
while Lieut.-General Sir Thomas Graham (afterwards
Lord Lynedoch) took post at Zafra. Lieut.-General Sir
Rowland Hill’s division then moved forward, and took
post at Medellin. When the breaches at Badajoz were
nearly practicable, Marshal Soult, having effected a
junction with Generals Drouet and Daricau, advanced
to relieve it. Viscount Wellington thereupon determined
to fight him at Albuhera. Lieut.-General Sir
Thomas Graham then fell back towards that place, and
Lieut.-General Sir Rowland Hill having destroyed the
bridge at Merida, marched from the Upper Guadiana
to Talavera Real. Marshal Soult did not however
advance in time, and <em>Badajoz</em> was taken on the 6th of
April.</p>

<p>After the fall of Badajoz, when Viscount Wellington
marched towards Beira, two divisions of British infantry,
in one of which was the second battalion of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>,
remained with Lieut.-General Sir Rowland Hill
in Estremadura, to cover Badajoz during the re-establishment
of its works. Nothing occurred in the army
until the 12th of May, when six thousand men, with
twelve field-pieces, crossed the Guadiana at Merida,
and joining the battering train and pontoons, formed
the force destined to surprise the French at <em>Almaraz</em>.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> remained in position on the
Guadiana, while the expedition proceeded to attack
the French works on the Bridge at <em>Almaraz</em>, on the
Tagus, which were captured on the 19th of May. The
bridge having been destroyed, and the communication
between the several divisions of the French army rendered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
more difficult, the British troops returned to the
south of the Guadiana.</p>

<p>A great part of June was passed in operations against
General Drouet, until he was reinforced on the 18th of
that month with General Barrois’s division of infantry,
and two divisions of cavalry. Hereupon Lieut.-General
Sir Rowland Hill fell back gradually to Albuhera, and
took up a position on the former field, awaiting an
attack. The enemy did not advance, and on the 2nd
of July, Lieut.-General Sir Rowland Hill broke up
from Albuhera, and moved upon General Drouet, who
retired towards Cordova. At the end of July, Lieut.-General
Sir Rowland Hill was at Llerena, and the
second battalion of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment, in
Brigadier-General Byng’s brigade, was detached to
Merida. General Drouet made a demonstration, but
no action of infantry ensued.</p>

<p>After the victory gained by the army under Viscount
Wellington on the 22nd of July at Salamanca, the
troops under Lieut.-General Sir Rowland Hill penetrated
the Spanish provinces: during the month of
August they were engaged in the pursuit of General
Drouet, and in the beginning of October they were on
the Tagus, between Aranjuez and Toledo.</p>

<p>While the army under the Marquis of Wellington,
which title was conferred upon him after the victory
of Salamanca, was engaged in the siege of the Castle
of <em>Burgos</em>, the second battalion of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>
regiment remained at Aranjuez. In consequence of the
necessity of raising the siege of Burgos, and retreating,
Lieut.-General Sir Rowland Hill broke up from his
ground on the Tagus, to effect a junction with the grand
army, which commenced its retrograde movement from
Burgos on the 21st of October.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span></p>

<p>On the 30th of October, Lieut.-General Sir Rowland
Hill, having taken up a position of defence on the
Jarama, was pressed by the enemy, who attacked the
bridge of Aranjuez. The French were repulsed by
Colonel Skerrett, with the forty-seventh (of which he was
the Lieutenant-Colonel), and part of the ninety-fifth
regiment, now the Rifle Brigade. The retreat continued
without molestation; and on the 8th of November, the
troops under Lieut.-General Sir Rowland Hill were
at Alba, while the Marquis of Wellington occupied the
heights of San Christoval. The brigade of the second
division, in which the second battalion of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>
was posted, being in the neighbourhood of the
fords of Encinas.</p>

<p>On the 14th of November, the enemy passed the river
near that place, and the Marquis of Wellington moved
with the second division to attack him, while the
remainder of the troops were ordered towards the
Arapiles in the evening. No engagement occurred.
The enemy fortified himself at Mozarbes, on the ground
he had taken up the night before, and moved bodies of
cavalry and infantry to the communication with Ciudad
Rodrigo. The superiority of numbers on the part of
the French caused the British army to continue its
march to Ciudad Rodrigo, which it reached on the
19th of November. Thus ended the retreat from
Burgos. The men had suffered greatly on the march
and required rest; the enemy had pressed the retreat
closely with his cavalry, and made an attack upon the
rear upon the passage of the Huebra; the roads were
difficult, and in some parts impassable. The second
battalion of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> did not share in the hardships
of the main retreat until it had crossed the
Tormes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span></p>

<p>Marshal Soult having retired to the Upper Tormes,
towards the pass of Banos, it was reported that he
intended to invade Portugal by the valley of the Tagus.
Lieut.-General Sir Rowland Hill’s division was therefore
moved to the right as far as Robledo, to cover the
pass of Perales. King Joseph, however, in December,
took up his position for the winter, and the allied
army was also distributed in quarters.</p>

<p>Lieut.-General Sir Rowland Hill’s division occupied
Coria and Placentia, the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> being cantoned
in the latter place.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1813</div>

<p>The allied army remained in cantonments until the
month of May 1813; on the 19th of that month the
second battalion of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>, in the second
division, broke up from its winter-quarters, and, forming
a part of the right wing of the army, shared in the
operations during the advance upon Burgos and Vittoria;
in the plan for the action of the 21st of June,
before <em>Vittoria</em>, Lieut.-General Sir Rowland Hill’s corps,
composed of Morillo’s Spaniards, Sylveira’s Portuguese,
and the second British division, forming the right of
the allied army, was to attack the enemy’s left, and
forcing the passage of the lower Zadora, at Puebla,
assail the French on the heights beyond, entering the
plain of Vittoria, by the defile of La Puebla. The
river was passed about ten o’clock <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, and Morillo’s
Spaniards assailed the mountain with his first brigade;
but meeting with much resistance on the heights, called
up his second brigade, which, the French being also
reinforced, was supported by part of the second division,
while Lieut.-General Sir Rowland Hill, with the rest,
passed through the defile, and, seizing the village of
<em>Subijana de Alava</em>, held his ground: he thus connected
his own right with the troops on the mountain, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
maintained this forward position, although the French
made great efforts to dislodge the allies from this
vantage-ground.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the fourth division crossed by the bridge
of Nanclares. The action on the British right was severe,
and sustained with great gallantry. The French, being
driven from all their defences, retreated with such precipitation
towards Pampeluna as to abandon all their
baggage, artillery, ammunition, military chests, and the
court equipage of King Joseph, whose carriage being
seized, he had barely time to escape on horseback.
The defeat was the most complete that the French had
experienced in Spain.</p>

<p>The bâton of Marshal Jourdan was taken, and the
Prince Regent, in the name and behalf of his Majesty,
appointed the Marquis of Wellington a Field-Marshal.
In a most flattering letter, the Prince Regent thus conferred
the honor:&mdash;“You have sent me among the
trophies of your unrivalled fame, the staff of a French
Marshal, and I send you in return that of England.”</p>

<p>During part of the day, the second battalion of the
<span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> was stationed to cover a brigade of guns:
its loss was not very great, being one private killed, and
thirteen wounded. Captain Girdlestone was the only
officer of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> who was wounded.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel Leith received a medal for his conduct
in command of the battalion, and the Royal Authority
was afterwards given for the word “<span class="smcap">Vittoria</span>” to be
inscribed on the Regimental Colour and Appointments
of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment, to commemorate the
gallantry of the second battalion in that battle.</p>

<p>The second battalion of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment
shared in the pursuit of the enemy after his defeat at
Vittoria, and, when the Marquis of Wellington marched<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
on the 26th of June to intercept the French General
Clausel, it remained with the other corps of the second
division for the siege of <em>Pampeluna</em>.</p>

<p>Although the enemy had withdrawn his right and
left into France, he maintained his centre in force in
the rich valley of <em>Bastan</em>, which afforded numerous
strong positions, and the troops under Lieut.-General
Sir Rowland Hill, having been relieved from the
blockade of Pampeluna, advanced to dislodge the
French. On the 4th of July, and the three following
days, General Gazan was driven from the valley of
Bastan by the troops under Lieut.-General Sir Rowland
Hill, and the positions abandoned by the enemy were
occupied by the British. Major-General Byng’s brigade,
of which the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> formed part, with some
Spanish corps under General Morillo, took possession of
the Pass of <em>Roncesvalles</em> on the 7th of July. In this celebrated
valley the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> remained for a few days.</p>

<p>Marshal Soult having arrived at Bayonne on the
13th of July to command, as Lieutenant of the Emperor,
the united French army of Spain, amounting to above
seventy-eight thousand men, exclusive of garrisons,
collected more than sixty thousand of his own left, and
advanced on the 25th of July to force the Pass of
<em>Roncesvalles</em>. The brigade which had been ordered to
occupy the Pass, and of which the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> formed
a part, kept the French in check for several hours, but
was obliged to fall back, on perceiving that a strong
body had succeeded in turning the position.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> had two privates killed, and three
wounded, in the action on the 25th of July. On the
28th and 30th of July, the battalion was engaged in
the attack made upon the enemy on the heights in
front of <em>Pampeluna</em>, and had Captain Girdlestone,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
Ensign Smith, and Quarter-Master McIntosh, together
with thirty-three rank and file, wounded:&mdash;two rank and
file were killed.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel Leith received a clasp, in addition to
his former medal, for his conduct on these occasions.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment subsequently received the
Royal Authority to bear the word “<span class="smcap">Pyrenees</span>” on the
Regimental Colour and Appointments, to commemorate
the services of the second battalion in these several combats,
which have been designated the “<em>Battles of the
Pyrenees</em>.”</p>

<p>On the 31st of July, Major-General Byng’s brigade
captured a large convoy near <em>Elizondo</em>, and made many
prisoners.</p>

<p>The British troops resumed their position in the
Pyrenees, awaiting the capture of St. Sebastian and
Pampeluna. St. Sebastian was captured on the 31st of
August, and on the 31st of October the French
garrison of Pampeluna surrendered prisoners of war.</p>

<p>Pampeluna being captured, the right of the allied
army, which had been employed in covering the blockade,
became disengaged, and the British Commander
looking down from the lofty Pyrenees on the well-guarded
territory of France, resolved to carry the war
into the heart of that country. The British army,
early on the morning of the 10th of November,
descended into the valleys on the French side; the
division of which the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> formed part
entered France by the Pass of <em>Maya</em>, having sustained
some loss in the capture of one of the enemy’s redoubts.
Only one man belonging to the battalion was killed,
but Captain Girdlestone and eleven rank and file were
wounded. Marshal Soult’s army was driven from his
fortified position on the river <em>Nivelle</em>, and several guns<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
and prisoners were captured. The French being pursued
on the following day, retired to their fortified
camp near Bayonne.</p>

<p>Captain Thomas Samuel Nicolls was promoted to
the rank of Major in the army for his conduct on this
day, and the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> afterwards received the
Royal Authority to bear the word “<span class="smcap">Nivelle</span>” on the
Regimental Colour and Appointments, in testimony of
the gallantry of the second battalion in that action.</p>

<p>The passage of the river <em>Nive</em> was effected on the
9th of December: the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> passed over without
the loss of a man, one serjeant only being wounded.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel Leith received an additional clasp
for his conduct on this occasion, and Captains Patrick
Dowdall and Peter Fearon were promoted to the rank
of Majors in the army.</p>

<p>On the 13th of December, the second battalion of the
<span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment shared in the action at <em>St.
Pierre</em>, near Bayonne, when the enemy abandoned two
pieces of cannon, which were taken possession of by
Captain Hemsworth’s company.</p>

<p>The Marquis of Wellington, in his despatch dated
<em>St. Jean de Luz</em>, 14th December 1813, thus alluded to
the conduct of the brigade under Major-General John
Byng,<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> of which the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> formed part.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I had great satisfaction, also, in observing the conduct
of Major-General Byng’s brigade of British
infantry, supported by the fourth Portuguese brigade,
under the command of Brigadier-General
Buchan, in carrying an important height from the
enemy on the right of our position, and maintaining
it against all their efforts to regain it.</p>

<p>“<em>Two guns and some prisoners</em> were taken from the
enemy, who being beaten at all points, and having
suffered considerable loss, were obliged to retire
upon their entrenchment.”</p>
</div>

<p>In a very interesting life of the late Viscount Hill,
by the Reverend Edwin Sidney, A.M. is the following
account of the action at <em>St. Pierre</em>, near Bayonne.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“This great service was thus performed by Sir
Rowland Hill. The enemy, who had failed in all
their attempts with their whole force upon Lord
Wellington’s left, withdrew to their entrenchments
on the night of December 12th, and passed a large
body of troops through the town of Bayonne. With
these, on the morning of the 13th, they made a desperate
attack on Sir Rowland Hill. This, as has
appeared, was not unexpected; and Lord Wellington
had placed at his disposal not only the sixth division,
but the fourth division, and two brigades of the third.
Soult’s objects were to gain the bridge of <em>St. Pierre</em>,
to make himself master of the road to St. Jean Pied
de Port, and to break through the position of the
allies. For these purposes he put forth his whole
strength, and was completely vanquished. Even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
before the sixth division arrived, Sir Rowland Hill
had repulsed him with prodigious loss; and although
he skilfully availed himself of a high ground in
retreating, he could not stand against the famous
charge of General Byng, and was entirely defeated.
It was a battle fought and won by the corps of Sir
Rowland Hill alone and unaided. At the instant of
victory Lord Wellington came up, and in the ecstasy
of the moment of triumph, caught him by the hand,
and said, ‘Hill, the day is your own.’”</p>
</div>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> had seven rank and file <em>killed</em>,
and three serjeants, two drummers, and twenty-seven
rank and file <em>wounded</em>.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel Leith, who received a cross for his
conduct, was slightly wounded. Ensign Hardy died
of his wounds.</p>

<p>Brevet Major Peter Fearon, of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>
regiment, who commanded the fifth Portuguese Caçadores,
received an additional distinction to the medal
which had been granted him for the battle of Albuhera.</p>

<p>The <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> subsequently received the Royal
Authority to bear on the Regimental colour the word
“<span class="smcap">Nive</span>,” to commemorate the gallantry of the second
battalion in the actions which ensued on the passage of
that river.</p>

<p>No further actions occurred during the few remaining
days of the year 1813; and the army occupied
winter-quarters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1814</div>

<p>Leaving their cantonments at the village of St.
Pierre, the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> advanced with the troops
under Lieut.-General Sir Rowland Hill, in the middle
of February 1814, when the French corps, under
General Harispe, were driven from Hellete, and afterwards
forced from a position on the heights of <em>Garris</em><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
on the 15th of February. The battalion had one
private killed, and six rank and file wounded. Brevet
Major Peter Fearon, who commanded the fifth Portuguese
Caçadores, died of his wounds. The other officer
wounded was Captain Knox, who was subsequently
promoted to the brevet rank of major.</p>

<p>On the 27th of February, the second battalion of
the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>, in Lieut.-General Sir Rowland Hill’s
division, crossed the Adour, on the right of <em>Orthes</em>,
with the loss of only two rank and file wounded.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel Leith gained another distinction, and
the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> afterwards received the Royal Authority
to bear the word “<span class="smcap">Orthes</span>” on the Regimental
Colour and Appointments, in commemoration of the
conduct of the second battalion in that battle.</p>

<p>Advancing rapidly against the enemy, Lieut.-General
Sir Rowland Hill engaged him at <em>Aire</em>, on
which occasion the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> had Ensign Hardcastle
(Captain in the third Portuguese Caçadores) one
serjeant, and two rank and file wounded.</p>

<p>On the 10th of April, the second battalion of the
<span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment was in action with the French
in the suburbs of <em>Toulouse</em>, and had one private
wounded.</p>

<p>During the night of the 11th of April, the French
army evacuated Toulouse, and the white flag was
hoisted. On the day following, the Marquis of Wellington
entered the city amidst the acclamations of the
inhabitants. In the afternoon of this day intelligence
was received of the abdication of Napoleon; and had
not the express been delayed on the journey by the
French police, the sacrifice of many valuable lives
would have been prevented. A disbelief in the truth
of this intelligence occasioned much unnecessary bloodshed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
at <em>Bayonne</em>, the garrison of which made a desperate
sortie on the 14th of April, and Lieut.-General Sir
John Hope (afterwards Earl of Hopetoun) was wounded
and taken prisoner. Major-General Andrew Hay was
killed, and Major-General Stopford was wounded.
This was the last action of the Peninsular war.</p>

<p>The advance of the Allied troops into the heart of
France led to a Treaty of Peace, by which Louis XVIII.
was restored to the throne of that kingdom, and Napoleon
Bonaparte was permitted to reside at Elba, the
sovereignty of that Island having been conferred upon
him by the Allied Powers.</p>

<p>The war being ended, the second battalion of the
<span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment was ordered to return to
England. It marched from Toulouse to Bourdeaux
on the 3rd of June, and on the 12th of July embarked
in the Rodney, disembarking on the 23rd at the Cove
of Cork, whence it immediately marched to Middleton.</p>

<p>In commemoration of the services of the second
battalion, the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> subsequently received the
Royal Authority to bear the word “<span class="smcap">Peninsula</span>,” on the
Regimental Colour and Appointments, in addition to
the names of the several actions in which the second
battalion had taken a prominent part, during the war
in Spain from 1808 to 1814, namely, “<span class="smcap">Talavera</span>,”
“<span class="smcap">Albuhera</span>,” “<span class="smcap">Vittoria</span>,” “<span class="smcap">Pyrenees</span>,” “<span class="smcap">Nivelle</span>,”
“<span class="smcap">Nive</span>,” and “<span class="smcap">Orthes</span>.”</p>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel Alexander Leith was nominated a
Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath for his
conduct in command of the second battalion during
the Peninsular war.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel George Guy Carleton L’Estrange,
who was promoted from major in the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>
regiment, to the rank of Lieut.-Colonel in the twenty-sixth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
regiment on the 15th of December 1812, was
nominated a Companion of the Order of the Bath for
his conduct while serving with the second battalion of
the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment.</p>

<p>On the 23rd of September, the <em>second battalion</em> proceeded
to Portsmouth, where it was disbanded on the
24th of October 1814, the officers and men, fit for service,
being transferred to the <em>first battalion</em> of the
<span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment, at that period stationed in
Sicily.</p>

<p class="p2 smcap center">The Honorable Charles Cathcart,</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 13th August 1728</em>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Honorable Charles Cathcart</span>, son of Alan, seventh
Lord Cathcart, entered the army in the eighteenth year of
his age, and in 1704 he commanded a company in Colonel
Macartney’s regiment (since disbanded), serving on the frontiers
of Holland. In 1706 he commanded a troop in the
Scots Greys, which corps distinguished itself at the battle of
Ramilies in the same year: in 1707 he was brigade major to
the Earl of Stair. Continuing in active service with the
army under the Duke of Marlborough, he acquired the reputation
of a brave and zealous officer: in 1709 he was appointed
major of the Scots Greys, and was soon afterwards
promoted to the lieut.-colonelcy of the regiment. On the
accession of King George I., he was appointed one of the
grooms of His Majesty’s bedchamber. In the autumn of
1715 he joined the forces under the Duke of Argyle at Stirling,
and served against the rebels under the Earl of Mar.
On the 23rd of October, he was detached against a hundred
rebel horse and two hundred foot, whom he attacked with his
dragoons, killed many, and took seventeen prisoners. At the
battle of Sheriffmuir on the 13th of November, in the same
year, he charged the insurgents at the head of the Scots<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
Greys, and contributed materially to the overthrow of the
left wing of the rebel army. His Majesty rewarded him with

<p class="p2 center"><em>Memoir of the Services of</em> <span class="smcap">Colonel Samuel Bolton, C.B.</span>
<em>of the</em> <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> <em>Regiment</em>.</p>

<p class="noindent">This officer was appointed an ensign in the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>
regiment on the 5th of February 1807, in which regiment
he was promoted to be lieutenant on the 6th of April 1809.
Lieutenant Bolton served with the second battalion during
the Peninsular war from 1808 to 1814, and was present at the
battles of Talavera, Busaco, and Albuhera, in the last of which
he was wounded: took part in the capture of Marshal
Girard’s division at Arroyo dos Molinos on the 28th of
October 1811, and shared in the battle of Vittoria; also in
the actions in the Pyrenees, at the Nive, Garris, Orthes,
Aire, and Toulouse.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Bolton was appointed adjutant to the second
battalion on the 31st of March 1813, but returned to his
duty as lieutenant upon the reduction of the second battalion
on the 24th of October 1814. He was promoted to the rank
of captain on the 24th of October 1822; and on the 7th
of February 1825, embarked with the left wing of the regiment
for the East Indies. Captain Bolton was promoted to
the rank of major in the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment on the 14th
of June 1833, and to that of lieutenant-colonel on the 24th
of November 1835.</p>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel Bolton served in the Affghanistan campaign
of 1842, and commanded the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment in the
action at Mazeena, in the Shinwaree valley, on the 26th of
July 1842; at Tezeen on the 13th of September 1842, and
at the occupation of Cabool by Major-General Pollock.</p>

<p>For his services in Affghanistan, Lieut.-Colonel Bolton
received a medal, and was promoted to the rank of colonel
on the 23rd of December 1842; he was also appointed aide-de-camp
to Her Majesty, and was nominated a Companion
of the Most Honorable Order of the Bath.</p>

<p>Colonel Bolton served with the army of the Sutlej in 1845,
as Brigadier to the first brigade under the command of
General Sir Hugh (now Viscount) Gough, Commander-in-Chief
in India at that period. Colonel Bolton received a
severe wound at the battle of <em>Moodkee</em> on the 18th of December
1845, from the effects of which he died on the 4th of
January 1846.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Lieut.-Colonel Thomas Skinner, C.B.</span><a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lieut.-Colonel Thomas Skinner</span>, the eldest son of Lieut.-General
John Skinner, while at Eton College, was on the
25th of January 1816, appointed to an ensigncy in the sixteenth
regiment of foot, to which regiment his father had been
attached for thirty-nine years, before he attained the rank of
Major-General; Ensign Skinner joined the sixteenth regiment
in Ireland in the year 1817, then commanded by the
late Major-General (then Colonel) Tolley. Major-General
Tolley, the best Greek scholar of his day at Westminster,
amused his leisure with classical literature, and invited the
young Etonian to share his studies; and thus making complete
his education, fortunately imbued him with that taste for
letters which secured to him through life a most agreeable
resource. In 1819, the regiment being ordered to Ceylon,
he obtained, by purchase, a lieutenancy on the 6th of August,
and proceeded to that colony. While there he was employed
to make the roads constructed by the late Lieut.-General Sir
Edward Barnes, afterwards Colonel of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>
regiment. Lieutenant Skinner was appointed adjutant to
the sixteenth regiment on the 20th of April 1820, and did
duty in that capacity until 1822, when his Commanding
Officer returned to England, and obtaining leave of absence
for his young friend, they travelled home together through
India and Egypt, visiting Malta and Sicily, and thence
through Italy and France to England. Lieutenant Skinner
was promoted to an unattached company on the 9th of October
1823, and on the 20th of March, 1824, was appointed Captain
in the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment. In February 1825, he
sailed with the left wing of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> in the <em>Scaleby
Castle</em> for Calcutta, the regiment being ordered to reinforce
the army at that time acting in Burmah; but owing to the
burning of her consort, the <i>Kent</i> East Indiaman, in the Bay
of Biscay, with the right wing, the regiment was inefficient,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
and remained in garrison at Calcutta. In 1829, Captain
Skinner returned home on leave of absence in the <i>Cartha</i>, and
nearly suffered shipwreck on the coast of Wales. The vessel
being driven by storm when off Liverpool, was unable to
weather Bardsea Island, and fortunately passed safely through
the narrow channel between that rock, and the coast of Carnarvon
into Pwelli Bay. He did not lose his time in India;
for with his brother, Captain James Skinner, of the sixty-first
regiment of Bengal Native Infantry, he travelled to the
sources of the Ganges and the Jumna, an account of which
was published in 1833, from letters written at the time, in
two volumes, entitled “<cite>Excursions in India</cite>,” and the work
passed through two editions. During his leave of absence he
travelled over England and Scotland, and made himself as
well acquainted with those parts of his native land, as, in the
course of his professional duties, he had previously become
with Ireland. In December 1833, by permission of General
Lord Hill, Commanding in Chief, he travelled by the Holy
Land and Bagdad to India to rejoin the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment.
An account of these travels, in two volumes, was
published in 1836, under the title of “<cite>Adventures during
a Journey overland to India</cite>” which also passed through two
editions. On the 24th of November, 1835, he was promoted
Major in the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment. Emulous of his father’s
skill as an officer of Light Infantry, he diligently cultivated
that branch of the service, availing himself of the opportunity
of practising manœuvres in the field afforded to those serving
in India, by the collection of large bodies of men at the principal
stations. In 1840, his health being affected by the
climate, Lord Hill considerately forwarded to him, through
the General commanding in India, leave of absence, of which
he declined to avail himself, as he thought his services might
be useful in the then state of India. On the 23rd of November
1840, he was entrusted to take from Chinsurah a large
body of recruits, about twenty young officers, and about twenty-two
young women and as many children, to their destinations
where they arrived in health, and without complaint of any
sort against them in the districts through which they passed.
The Commander-in-Chief in India thus expressed his thanks
for this unprecedented success in such duty.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Commander-in-Chief takes an early opportunity of conveying
his best thanks to Major Skinner, of Her Majesty’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment, for the forethought, caution, and
exertion shown by him in marching a body of 489 recruits
from Chinsurah to Cawnpore and Agra, without the loss of
a man, except one accidentally drowned while bathing in
the Soane. His Excellency requests that Major Skinner
will report to him in what degree the medical officers
contributed to this very desirable result, in order that
their skill and attention may be duly appreciated and
remembered.”</p>
</div>

<p>Major Skinner, for this service, was rewarded with the
appointment of Commandant of the Convalescent Depôt at
Landour.</p>

<p>Upon the march of the army under Major-General Pollock
to Affghanistan, where Captain James Skinner, of the sixty-first
Bengal Native Infantry, was reported to be a prisoner,
having been wounded on the retreat from Cabool, Major
Skinner resigned at once his lucrative and pleasant post, and by
forced journeys, joined the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment, in February
1842; his anxiety for his brother, whom he had hoped to
be in part the means of rescuing, only appeased by the distressing
certainty of his violent and untimely death. Major Skinner
rendered very important services at the battle of <em>Mazeena</em>,
for which he was particularly thanked by Brigadier Monteath;
Major Skinner’s account of the transaction was also included
in the despatches published in the “London Gazette.”</p>

<p>From the fatigue and exposure in the action at <em>Mazeena</em> on
the 26th of July 1842, Major Skinner was seized with the
fever of that country, living, to avoid the heat and dust, in a
hole dug in the ground, the air being pestilent and the water
corrupt, from the mortality of animals. His life was, however,
spared for the service of his country. Though still
suffering from the malignant disease, which rest might then
have cured, he commenced his labours, being removed from
the sick list on the very day he marched with the second
division, under Major-General McCaskill, commanding, on
the 8th of September 1842, the advance guard to Soorkhab,
on the 9th to Jugdulluck; a running fight being kept up the
whole way; on the 10th to Kutta Sung; and on the 11th the
rear-guard to Tezeen. He was specially thanked in Major-General
McCaskill’s despatches for the manner in which he
performed these duties. In the afternoon of the 12th of
September he <ins class="corr" id="tn-228" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'was despached to'">
was despatched to</ins> the heights of the Huft-Kotul,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
and commenced at daylight of the 13th, by attacking the enemy
on the heights, those operations which ended in the <ins class="corr" id="tn-229" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'victory of Tezeeu'">
victory of Tezeen</ins>. Major-general Pollock stated, “that the Major’s
duty was performed with great gallantry, and his operations
contributed much to frustrate the attempts of the enemy on
the right flank.” The Major-General enclosed in the despatches
the detailed account of Major Skinner’s movements,
which were published in the “London Gazette.”</p>

<p>Proceeding from Tezeen to Cabool on the 10th of October,
<ins class="corr" id="tn-229a" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'he comanded five'">
he commanded five</ins> companies of the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> regiment
at the destruction of the Great Bazaar, which, from the skilful
arrangement of the force, was effected almost without loss of
life. On the march from Cabool to India his conduct was
thought from time to time deserving of praise by those under
whom he acted. On his arrival at Ferozepore, he was chosen
for the imposing duty of commanding the Guard of Honor,
consisting of artillery, cavalry, and infantry, escorting the
embassy to Lahore.</p>

<p>On the 23rd of December 1842, he was promoted to the
rank of lieut.-colonel in the army, was three days afterwards
made a Companion of the Most Honorable Military Order of
the Bath, and was presented by the government of India with
the silver medal of Cabool, bearing on one side “<em>Cabool</em> 1842,”
and on the other “<em>Victoria Vindex</em>.”</p>

<p>Unfortunately Lieut.-Colonel Skinner did not live long to
enjoy the rewards of his useful services, for his decease
occurred on the 5th of May 1843, at Mussoorie, in the
Himalaya Mountains, from disease brought on by privation
and fatigue during the Affghan campaign. Lieut.-Colonel
Skinner was buried the next morning at Landour with military
honors, the arms of a native corps being borrowed for the
European invalids stationed there at their own request. They
formed the funeral procession and firing party, an honorable
mark of respect never before paid by them on any similar
occasion. The body was attended to the grave by every
European, civil or military, in the place, and by a very large
proportion of the native population, to whom he had been
previously known as commandant, and by whom he was
greatly loved and deeply lamented. His brother officers
erected over his remains a tomb of Delhi stone, and his death
was announced to the regiment by Colonel Bolton in a regimental
order, which did full justice to his merits “<em>as a good and gallant officer</em>,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
expressing at the same time, that “<i>he
was devotedly attached to his profession, and that he was the
warm advocate and steady friend of the well-deserving
soldier</i>.”</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Major George Baldwin.</span></p>

<p>This officer commenced his military career as ensign in the
thirty-sixth regiment, on the 2nd of June 1808. He served
in Holland during 1809 and 1810, and was present at the capture
of Walcheren and siege of Flushing. Ensign Baldwin
was removed from the thirty-sixth to the third Ceylon regiment
on the 4th of April 1811, and was promoted to the rank of
lieutenant in the fourteenth regiment of foot on the 9th of
November 1814. Lieutenant Baldwin was present at the
memorable battle of Waterloo, for which he received a medal,
and served at the storming of Cambray on the 24th of
June 1815. He exchanged from the half-pay of the seventy-fifth
regiment to the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span> on the 14th of March 1822,
and embarked for India on the 7th of February 1825, with
the right wing of the regiment on board the ship <i>Kent</i>, which
was burnt at sea on the 1st of March following. Lieutenant
Baldwin received a severe injury when the ship was in flames,
by an iron spike running into his thigh. Lieutenant Baldwin
was promoted to the rank of Captain in the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>
regiment on the 14th of June 1833. He served in the campaign
of Affghanistan in 1842; was present in the action at
Mazeena on the 26th of July 1842; at Tezeen on the 13th of
September following; and at the occupation of Cabool by
Major-General Pollock. For his services in Affghanistan he
was rewarded with a medal, and received the brevet rank of
major on the 23rd of December 1842. On the 8th of October
1844 he was promoted to the rank of major in the <span class="allsmcap">THIRTY-FIRST</span>
regiment. Major Baldwin served with the army of the
Sutlej in 1845, was present at the battles of Moodkee and
Ferozeshah; in the latter he was mortally wounded. Major
Baldwin died on the 30th of December 1845.</p>

<p class="noindent">The advantages arising from the services of corps
trained to the use of arms <em>on board of ship, as well as
on land</em>, were found when the British navy acquired a
superiority over that of other nations of Europe; and
as the safety of Great Britain, from its insular position,
chiefly depends on the efficiency and excellence of
her fleets, the importance and value of <em>Marine Forces</em>
have consequently been at all times acknowledged and
appreciated by the Sovereign, as well as by the Nation
at large.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1664</div>

<p>The first corps raised for Sea-service, of which
history gives an account, is that which was formed by
King Charles II., in the year 1664, when the war
with Holland took place: this corps was commanded
by the Duke of York (afterwards King James II.),
then Lord High Admiral of Great Britain, and was
designated “<em>The Admiral’s Maritime Regiment</em>.”<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2a"></a>[2]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1672</div>

<p>In the year 1672 a dispute on the subject of naval
precedence, and other causes, gave rise to another war
with the Dutch, and battalions for <em>Sea-service</em> were
formed, as the occasions of the State required, by
drafts from the land forces, which were embarked on
board the fleet; several companies of the Foot Guards
were employed on the Marine duty; these companies
were engaged in a sharp fight with the Dutch fleet
on the 28th of May, 1672, in which upwards of two
thousand men were killed; they were also engaged in
several other actions during the war which ended in
February, 1674.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1689</div>

<p>In 1689 King William III. incorporated “<em>the
Admiral’s Regiment</em>” (which was then considered the
third regiment of Infantry) in the Second, now the
Coldstream, regiment of Foot Guards. Two Marine
regiments were, about the same time, established for
service on board the fleet, which were disbanded in 1698.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1702</div>

<p>On the recommencement of hostilities, in 1702, with
France and Spain, both of which nations possessed
powerful fleets as well as numerous armies, the British
Parliament felt the expediency of enabling the Queen
to increase the efficiency of her navy, by forming <em>Corps
of Marines</em>, which could act at sea as well as on land.</p>

<p>Six regiments were accordingly added in the year
1702 to the regular Army as <em>Marine corps</em>, and six other
of the regular regiments of Infantry were appointed
for <em>Sea-service</em>; as shown in the following list.</p>

<p class="noindent">The six Regiments of Marines were:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent pad3">
Colonel Thomas Saunderson’s, now thirtieth foot.<br />
Colonel George Villiers’s, now thirty-first foot.<br />
Colonel Edward Fox’s, now thirty-second foot.<br />

Colonel Henry Holl’s; disbanded in 1713.<br />
Colonel Viscount Shannon’s; disbanded in 1713.<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3a"></a>[3]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">The six regiments of Foot for <em>Sea-service</em> were:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent pad3">
Colonel Ventris Columbine’s, now sixth foot.<br />
Colonel Thomas Erle’s, now nineteenth foot.<br />

Colonel Lord Lucas’s, now thirty-fourth foot.<br />
Colonel Earl of Donegal’s, now thirty-fifth foot.<br />
Colonel Lord Charlemont’s, now thirty-sixth foot.<br />
</p>

<p>Her Majesty’s Order for levying this body of men
was contained in the following Royal Warrant, dated
1st of June, 1702:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">“<span class="smcap">Anne R.</span></p>

<p>“Our pleasure is, that this establishment of
<em>six regiments of Marines</em>, and six other regiments for
<em>Sea-Service</em>, do commence and take place from the
respective times of raising.</p>

<p>“And our further pleasure is, that the order given
by our dearest brother the late King, deceased, and
such orders as are, or shall be, given by us, touching
the pay or entertainment of our said forces, or any of
them, or any charges thereunto belonging, shall be
duly complied with, and that no new charge be added
to this establishment without being communicated
to our High Treasurer, or Commissioners of our
Treasury for the time being.</p>

<p>“Given at our Court at St. James’s, on the first day
of June in the first year of our reign.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="padr4">“<em>By Her Majesty’s Command.</em></span><br />
“<span class="smcap">Godolphin.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>Other regiments were also embarked, at different
periods, during the war, on board the fleet to act as
Marines, and the efficiency and usefulness of these corps,
while so employed, were attested by the capture of
several fortresses in Spain; more especially that of
Gibraltar in 1704, the taking of which was effected
by the Navy and Marines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4a"></a>[4]</span></p>

<p>Rules and Instructions for the better government of
the Marine regiments were issued by authority of Her
Majesty Queen Anne, on the 1st of July, 1702, in
which it was directed, “That when on shore they were
to be quartered in the vicinity of the dock-yards, in
order to guard them from embezzlement, or from any
attempt that might be made on them by an enemy.”</p>

<p>Full instructions were also given as to their pay,
subsistence, and clothing, which directed, “that the
same deductions should be made for clothing as was
usual in the land forces. Also that one day’s pay in
every year be deducted from officers and soldiers for
the Hospital.</p>

<p>“When on board ship they were to have an equal
proportion of provisions with the seamen, without
any deductions from their pay, the soldiers receiving
short allowance money like the seamen.”</p>

<p>In order to render such portions of the Marine
regiments as might be on shore, useful on all occasions
when their services might be required, Her Majesty
directed, that it should rest with herself, or with the
Lord High Admiral, the Prince George of Denmark,
to dispose of them at such places nearest to the several
dock-yards as might be judged most convenient; and
as there might be occasion for labourers to despatch
necessary public works, Her Majesty empowered the
High Admiral, or the Commissioners for executing that
office, to cause to be employed in the dock-yards so
many of the marine soldiers as might be judged fitting,
and to make them such daily allowance for their labour,
besides their ordinary pay, as should seem reasonable.</p>

<p>The Marine forces being thus placed under the
control of the Lord High Admiral, His Royal Highness
was pleased in 1702, to nominate Colonel William<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5a"></a>[5]</span>
Seymour (of the fourth regiment of foot) to superintend
the whole, with the rank of Brigadier-General, whose
peculiar duties were to observe, that the men were comfortably
quartered, that the officers were attentive in
their respective departments, and that the marine
soldiers, when embarked on board of ship, were supplied
with proper sea-clothes and other suitable necessaries.
When the Marines were serving afloat, they
were to be under the command of the Naval Officers
of the ships.</p>

<p>The Uniform of the Marine forces consisted of high-crowned
leather-caps, covered with cloth of the same
colour as the facings of the regiment, and ornamented
with devices, the same as the caps worn by the grenadiers;
scarlet frock-coat; buff waist-belt; black pouch
carried in front, with bayonet-belt attached; buff gaiters.</p>

<p>During the reign of Queen Anne, certain Independent
Companies of Marines were raised for the purpose
of aiding in the defence of the British possessions in
the West Indies.</p>

<p>The first important service on which the Marine
corps were employed in this reign, was on board the
fleet under Admiral Sir Cloudesly Shovel, then commanding
in the Mediterranean, who was instructed to
make every possible arrangement, by conciliation or by
conquest, among the dependencies of the French and
Spanish monarchies, in order to ensure a cordial reception
of the Archduke Charles of Austria, in opposition
to Philip, Duke of Anjou, of France, to the throne of
Spain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1704</div>

<p>After some delays, the Archduke arrived at Lisbon
under Admiral Sir George Rooke, on the 25th of
February, 1704, in order to concert a plan of future
operations with his ally the King of Portugal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6a"></a>[6]</span></p>

<p>Sir George Rooke, after cruising with the fleet on
the coast of Portugal, returned to Lisbon, and took the
Prince of Hesse-Darmstadt on board, with whom he
sailed on the 20th of April to Barcelona. On the arrival
of the fleet before Barcelona, the Prince of Hesse sent a
letter to Don Velasco, the governor, requiring him to
surrender the town, which he refused. Information, however,
being received that the city would declare for
Charles III. if a show of attack were made,&mdash;sixteen
hundred Marines were accordingly landed at the request,
and under the command, of Major-General the
Prince of Hesse-Darmstadt, on the 19th of May,
1704: this force, being found to be inadequate for
the purpose, was re-embarked on the following day.</p>

<p>The next object of attack was the Rock of <em>Gibraltar</em>,
where the Prince of Hesse landed in the afternoon of
the 21st of July, 1704, with 1800 British and Dutch
Marines. Acting upon the decision of a council of
war, His Highness proceeded to cut off all communication
with the mainland, to bombard the place, and to
reduce it to the obedience of Charles III., King of
Spain. The governor, on being summoned, refused to
surrender, alleging that all the garrison had taken an
oath of allegiance to King Philip V.</p>

<p>Admiral Sir George Rooke having directed a
strong force to proceed against the South Mole, the
enemy was driven from his guns; several boats,
manned and armed, were then detached under the
command of Captain Whitaker, of the Navy, who soon
obtained possession of the great platform: about one
hundred of the besiegers, whose impetuous bravery
had carried them within the effects of a mine connected
with the fort, were killed or wounded by the explosion;
the rest, advancing rapidly, gained a redoubt half-way<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7a"></a>[7]</span>
between the mole and the town. The Governor,
at the urgent desire of the inhabitants, was induced to
capitulate, and the Prince of Hesse took possession of
the garrison on the evening of Sunday the 24th of July
1704. The loss in effecting the capture of this important
fortress was sixty-one killed, and two hundred and
six wounded. The attack of the seamen was one of
the boldest and most difficult ever made, being obliged to
climb up rocks and precipices. Thus was taken, in three
days, a fortress since made impregnable to all assaults.</p>

<p>The loss of Gibraltar disconcerted the measures of
Philip V., and of his grandfather Louis XIV. Eight
thousand men, under the Marquis de Villadarias, were
immediately detached from the Spanish army to retake
the fortress; and the French Admiral received orders
to engage the British and Dutch fleets, and to co-operate
in the recapture of Gibraltar. The hostile fleets
engaged on the 24th of August, about eleven leagues
south of Malaga, and, after each had suffered severely,
they were separated in the night. The enemy retired
to Toulon, and Sir George Rooke sailed to Gibraltar.
Here, after having held a Council of War, it was determined
to return home; and the confederate fleet sailed
for England, arriving at Spithead on the 25th of
September. Sir John Leake and Admiral Vanderdussen
were left at Lisbon to protect the coast of
Portugal, and relieve Gibraltar, if it should be
besieged as was anticipated.</p>

<p>The Marquis de Villadarias commenced the siege of
Gibraltar on the 22nd of October, and the garrison,
composed of Marines, under the command of the Prince
of Hesse, sustained a siege by seven thousand men.
The purpose of the enemy was to have stormed from
the South Mole, united with the desperate attempt of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8a"></a>[8]</span>
a Spanish forlorn-hope climbing the rock, and a general
attack from the mainland. The fortress was maintained
against very superior numbers; and the fire of the
enemy’s batteries having damaged the works, a body
of men was landed from the fleet to assist in the
defence. Brigadier Fox, and several other officers
and men, having been killed on the 5th of December,
1704, aid was solicited from the army in Portugal.
Admiral Sir John Leake accordingly sailed from
Lisbon on the 10th of December, with a fleet, having
on board a battalion of the first and second foot guards;
Barrymore’s regiment, now thirteenth foot; Donegal’s
regiment, now thirty-fifth foot; the Dutch regiment of
Waes; and a Portuguese regiment; amounting in all
to upwards of three thousand men. On their passage
they fell in with the enemy’s squadron under Monsieur
de Pointi, but they succeeded in arriving at Gibraltar,
although some of the transports had separated.</p>

<p>These corps were safely landed on the 18th of
December, and the Prince, strengthened by this reinforcement,
made a sortie on the 23rd, and destroyed
the lines, that had been erected within a <ins class="corr" id="tnm-8" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'hundred and and sixty'">
hundred and sixty</ins> paces of the palisade.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1705</div>

<p>The Marquis de Villadarias, having received a
considerable reinforcement, evinced a disposition to
storm the place, and on the 2nd of February, 1705,
an attempt was made against the Round Tower, to
ascertain what might be effected by a larger force. On
the 7th the enemy attacked with five hundred chosen
grenadiers, French and Walloons, commanded by Lieut.-General
Thouy, and supported by one thousand
Spanish troops. They ascended the hill in perfect
silence at daybreak, and again attempted to storm the
Round Tower, which was defended by Colonel Borr,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9a"></a>[9]</span>
of the Marines, now thirty-second regiment. The assailants,
by throwing from above great stones and grenades
on his men, at last obliged him to retire into that
part of the works where the foot guards were posted.
Flushed with success, they advanced too far; when they
were gallantly charged by Colonel Moncall, of Barrymore’s
(thirteenth) regiment, and driven from the Round
Tower. Colonel Rivett, of the Coldstream foot guards,
having got up the rock on the right of the covered-way
with twenty grenadiers, favoured very much Colonel
Moncall’s success. The garrison by this time had
assembled, and kept up so destructive a fire that the
enemy was obliged to make a precipitate retreat, losing
seventy men killed on the spot; upwards of two hundred
wounded; and one captain, four lieutenants, and forty
men taken. The loss on the part of the garrison was
twenty-seven men killed, and one hundred and twenty
wounded.</p>

<p>Marshal de Tessé arrived with additional troops
to carry on the siege; the garrison also received fresh
reinforcements from Portugal, besides supplies of every
description. Admiral Sir John Leake sailed from the
Tagus on the 6th of March, 1705, and his arrival in the
bay of Gibraltar on the 10th, was again so sudden,
that he completely surprised the Baron de Pointi,
together with the whole of his squadron, consisting of
live ships of the line, three of which were captured, and
two were driven on shore, and burnt by the enemy.</p>

<p>After a siege of seven months the enemy retired, in
April, giving up all hopes of being able to make any
impression on the fortress: his efforts were then confined
to a very feeble blockade.</p>

<p>The fortress of Gibraltar, seated upon the territory
of Spain, was thus rendered subject to the British<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10a"></a>[10]</span>
crown by the bravery of its Navy and Marines: its
possession was subsequently secured by the defence
made against the renewed efforts of the Spaniards in
1727, and by the glorious defence sustained by the
troops, under General Lord Heathfield, for three years,
from 1779 to 1782, when it exhibited to the nations of
Europe a brilliant instance of the combined exertions
of the British navy and army against the repeated,
but unsuccessful, attempts of Spain and France to
recover this important fortress.</p>

<p>After the Spaniards and French had desisted from
further attempts to retake Gibraltar, the Marine corps
were distributed in the several ships of war which
were collected in the Tagus, in order to co-operate with
the land forces on the coast of Spain.</p>

<p>Towards the end of May, the English fleet, with
about five thousand land forces on board, under the
joint command of Admiral Sir Cloudesly Shovel and
General the Earl of Peterborough, sailed from St.
Helen’s, and arrived at Lisbon on the 20th of June.
King Charles went on board the Ranelagh on the 23rd
of July, and the Dutch fleet having joined in the Tagus,
the confederate squadron sailed on the 28th, and
anchored at Gibraltar on the 11th of August. The
Prince of Hesse-Darmstadt, with the battalion of foot guards,
and the thirteenth and thirty-fifth regiments,
embarked, and the fleet sailed for Altea Bay: form
thence it again proceeded on its voyage, and anchored
before Barcelona on the 22nd of August.</p>

<p>The Earl of Peterborough commenced active operations
against <em>Barcelona</em> by an attack on the strong
fortress of <em>Montjuich</em>, situated on the opposite part of
the town, at which the disembarkation took place, the
troops having landed near the river Bassoz, about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11a"></a>[11]</span>
three miles east of Barcelona, on the 23rd and 24th of
August. On the 28th, King Charles went on shore,
when the inhabitants of the neighbouring towns and
villages flocked to the camp, and many took arms to
act as guerilla-bands and miquelets. A difference of
opinion on the part of the Dutch General occasioned
some delay, but it was ultimately determined to attack
the fortress of <em>Montjuich</em> by storm.</p>

<p>The storming party, consisting of four hundred
grenadiers, with a support of six hundred musketeers,
commanded by the Earl of Peterborough and the
Prince of Hesse-Darmstadt, commenced their march
about ten o’clock on the night of Sunday the 13th of
September round the mountains, and were followed by
another detachment, and a party of dragoons. After
traversing many miles of rugged mountain scenery, by
different tracks, the storming party appeared about
break of day at the foot of the mountain. Colonel
Southwell of the sixth foot, which was then acting as
Marines, was ordered to head the attack, and he
succeeded in driving the enemy from the outworks
into the castle. Upon this success the Prince of Hesse,
advancing with great eagerness through all the fire,
was shot with a musket-ball in the thigh, and upon
being carried to an adjacent cottage, expired: this
accident somewhat damped the spirits of the soldiers;&mdash;at
the same time a large reinforcement was seen
advancing from the town to aid the garrison in the
Castle, and the troops received orders from some
inferior officer to retire. The Earl of Peterborough
rushed to the spot, countermanded the order, seized
the half-pike out of Lord Charlemont’s hand, and
rallied and led back the soldiers to the posts they had
so nobly won. The Spaniards, who were advancing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12a"></a>[12]</span>
from the town, turned back, and the outworks of the
Fortress of Montjuich were thus gained; batteries
were constructed, and the inner works were assailed
with cannon-balls, bombs, and grenades. On the 17th
of September the Fort surrendered, and thus facilitated
the siege of the <em>City of Barcelona</em>, which was
prosecuted with vigour. The Admirals even relinquished
for a time their natural element, and acted on
shore as General Officers;&mdash;they came daily from their
ships with a body of men formed into companies,
having captains and lieutenants of their own. Cannon
and mortars were dragged up steep precipices by the
men; and a breach being declared practicable, a body of
soldiers prepared to attack the town: further effusion
of blood was spared, however, by the surrender of the
garrison, which capitulated on the 9th of October.</p>

<p>The capture of Barcelona gave additional reputation
to the arms of the allies, and this splendid achievement
was regarded with astonishment throughout Europe.
It was accompanied by the submission of nearly all
Catalonia; and Boyer, in his history of these wars,
observes, “all the generals, admirals, officers, private
soldiers, and seamen, engaged in this memorable expedition,
deserved each their share of the honour.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">1706</div>

<p>King Charles and his counsellors, instead of exerting
themselves to provide for the security of the towns
which had come into their possession, and collecting the
means for future conquests, spent their time and
money in balls and public diversions. The breaches
in <em>Barcelona</em>, and the fortress of <em>Montjuich</em>, were left
unrepaired, and the garrison unprovided for a siege.
Meanwhile King Philip was obtaining reinforcements
from the favourers of his cause in Portugal, Italy,
Provence, Flanders, and the Rhine, and he soon appeared<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13a"></a>[13]</span>
at the head of above twenty thousand men to
recapture the provinces he had lost. A powerful French
and Spanish force approached Barcelona by land; a
French fleet appeared before the town, and the garrison,
being weak in numbers, regiments were hurried
from other places, one English regiment travelling one
hundred and twenty miles on mules, in two days, to
take part in the defence of Barcelona. The siege was
commenced in the beginning of April, 1706, when the
soldiers repaired the breaches, and entered upon a
resolute and desperate defence. A severe conflict
took place on the 21st of April at <em>Montjuich</em>, in which
Lord Donegal, of the thirty-fifth regiment, lost his life,
and several prisoners were taken by the enemy; but
when the garrison was nearly exhausted, its numbers
decreased by deaths, wounds, sickness, and other causes,
to about a thousand effective men, and a practicable
breach was ready for the enemy to attack the place by
storm, the English and Dutch fleet arrived with five
regiments of foot; the French fleet hurried from before
the town; and the reinforcements were landed.</p>

<p>The French, who had prepared to storm the place
on the 10th of May, relaxed in their efforts, and raised
the siege on the following day, making a precipitate
retreat.</p>

<p>The important city of <em>Barcelona</em> being thus relieved,
the fleet sailed on the 12th of May, and landed the
forces of every description on the coast of Valencia.
This was preparatory to an attack on <em>Alicant</em>. The
capture of <em>Carthagena</em> was in the interim effected, and
a garrison of six hundred marines under Major Hedges
was established for its defence.</p>

<p>The fleet arrived off <em>Alicant</em> on the 26th of June,
when the Governor-General Mahoni, was summoned to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14a"></a>[14]</span>
surrender: a refusal being made by the garrison, consisting
of one thousand soldiers, and many inhabitants
of the town who had volunteered in its defence, the
bombardment of the city was resolved upon.</p>

<p>Brigadier Richard Gorges, who succeeded the Earl
of Donegal, as colonel of the thirty-fifth regiment,
then serving as marines, moved from Elcho on the 21st
of July to within a mile of Alicant, and all the marines
of the fleet, with eight hundred seamen, were landed
on that day, and on the following morning:&mdash;the bombardment
commenced on the evening of the 22nd. A
detachment of the navy, under Admiral Sir George
Byng, rendered very essential service by dismounting
many of the enemy’s guns on the coast. On the
24th of July the marines arrived from Carthagena,
and were immediately landed; after four days the
troops had gained possession of the suburbs, and all the
boats were manned, and armed, in order to attack the
town. On the 29th of July the ships having made a
practicable breach on the Round Tower, at the west
end of the place, and another at the middle of the
curtain, the soldiers advanced to storm them. General
Mahoni retired into the Castle, and was again summoned
by Brigadier Gorges, and was at length obliged
to surrender his charge on the 25th of August, after a
most gallant resistance, and a heavy loss.</p>

<p>The fleet proceeded to <em>Iviça</em>, where it arrived on the
9th of September: the governor immediately saluted,
and tendered submission to King Charles III. It
was next resolved to attack <em>Majorca</em>, which surrendered
on the 14th of September: a garrison of one
captain, one lieutenant, and one hundred marines,
was placed in this island.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1707</div>

<p>In June, 1707, an opportunity offered of co-operating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15a"></a>[15]</span>
with the Duke of Savoy and Prince Eugene, in an
intended attack upon Toulon: the fleet proceeded for
the coast of Italy, where it anchored, on the 28th of June,
between Nice and Antibes, about a league from the
Var: after a conference between the commanders-in-chief,
it was decided that a joint attack should be made
upon a part of the enemy’s army then entrenched upon
that river: the positions, being evacuated by the enemy,
were immediately occupied by six hundred British seamen
and marines: the passage was thus secured for
the Duke of Savoy to prosecute his designs, and frigates
were stationed along different parts of the sea-coast:
every aid was afforded by the fleet both as to men and
cannon; but the enemy having daily augmented his
forces, and having made a successful sally, the siege
was raised on the 10th of August, 1707, after a loss of
more than a thousand men. The French, from a sudden
dread of consequences, sunk a number of their
largest ships of war, which were ever after unfit for
service.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1708</div>

<p>King Charles having urged the reduction of Sardinia,
with a view to open a passage for his troops in
Naples to attack Sicily, as well as to secure a supply of
provisions for his armies, a body of marines was withdrawn
from <em>Tarragona</em>, a strong sea-port and garrison
in Catalonia, to assist in this enterprise. On the 12th
of August, 1708, the whole arrived before Cagliari, the
capital of Sardinia; and on receiving an equivocal answer
to the summons to surrender, the bombardment commenced
on that evening, and continued, without intermission,
until the next morning, when at the break of
day Major-General Wills (thirtieth regiment) and the
whole of the marines, with one Spanish regiment, were
landed. The place, in consequence, almost immediately
surrendered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16a"></a>[16]</span></p>

<p>The whole having been re-embarked, the fleet again
set sail on the 18th of August, 1708, for <em>Minorca</em>, and
arrived at Port Mahon on the 28th of that month.</p>

<p>At this period <em>two</em> of the Marine regiments were
drafted, and the officers and men were incorporated
into the other <em>four</em>, now employed on this service: this
measure had become necessary in order to supply the
casualties which had occurred, and to render these
corps effective. For this purpose all the marines
capable of duty, were drawn from the fleet about to
return home, in order to assist in the reduction of an
island, which, it was expected, would make a spirited
and tedious defence.</p>

<p>The first attack was against <em>Fort Fornede</em>, which was
cannonaded by two of the ships, and surrendered after
a contest of four hours; a detachment having been
pushed to <em>Citadella</em> the capital, it surrendered without
resistance:&mdash;the batteries were opened on the works
defending the town of <em>Port Mahon</em> on the 17th of
September, when, after a short but brisk fire, and the
loss of only six men, a lodgment was effected under
the walls of St. Philip’s Castle; and on the next day
the place surrendered.</p>

<p>Thus was this strong fortress, and the important
<em>Island of Minorca</em>, gained by a force of only two thousand
four hundred men; the garrison consisted of one thousand
soldiers, with upwards of one hundred pieces of
cannon mounted.</p>

<p>Admiral Sir George Byng arrived at Lisbon on the
14th of October, from Portsmouth, having Her Majesty
the Queen of Portugal on board; but although many
other objects of service were in contemplation, nothing
further was attempted during the remainder of the
year 1708.</p>

<p>On the 28th of October, 1708, the decease of His Royal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17a"></a>[17]</span>
Highness the Prince George of Denmark, Consort of
Her Majesty Queen Anne, and Lord High Admiral of
England, took place.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1709</div>

<p>In the early part of the year 1709 a plan was formed
to attack <em>Port Royal</em> in the province of Nova Scotia,
at that time in possession of the French: for this
purpose a body of four hundred marines was embarked,
and the expedition was entrusted to the joint conduct
of Colonel Nicholson of the Marine forces, and Captain
Martin of the Navy. The squadron proceeded for
Boston, where they were reinforced by some ships,
and provincial auxiliaries: for this intended conquest
a council of war was held, and arrangements were
made for the debarkation of a body consisting of two
thousand five hundred men, which took place on the
24th of September. On the 1st of October the Governor
surrendered the fortress, and a garrison of
Marines took possession. The fortress was named
<em>Anna-polis Royal</em>, in honour of Queen Anne, in whose
reign it was conquered.</p>

<p>At this period the prospects of King Charles III. in
obtaining the monarchy of Spain, had become very
gloomy and doubtful. The town of Alicant had sustained
along and obstinate siege, against very powerful
forces of Spain and France. The garrison, consisting
principally of Marines, exhibited the most heroic perseverance
in maintaining the place. The fleet under
Admiral Sir George Byng, and the troops on board,
under the command of General Stanhope, were to
have attempted its relief, and the squadron was at the
same time to have attacked the enemy’s lines along
the sea shore; but the weather continuing severe, and
heavy gales preventing communication with the town,
the Commander-in-Chief deemed it necessary to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18a"></a>[18]</span>
propose terms of surrender, and the remainder of
the brave troops were embarked on board of the fleet,
which now proceeded to Tarragona, Port Mahon, and
afterwards to Barcelona. During the remainder of
the year 1709, the fleets attempted nothing beyond
the protecting of the convoys of provisions, where they
were considered necessary, and in harassing the commerce
of the enemy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1710</div>

<p>On the 13th of March, 1710, Admiral Sir John
Norris arrived at Port Mahon, as Commander-in-Chief
of the Naval forces. After making arrangements
for disposing of the ships and troops in attacks upon
the enemy, he proceeded to Barcelona on the 18th of
June, in order to concert future operations with His
Majesty King Charles III.</p>

<p>An expedition was planned against the <em>Isle of Cette</em>
in the province of Languedoc, where the troops and
Marines were landed on the 13th of July. The place
made a feeble resistance, and the Fort, upon which
were mounted eighteen pieces of cannon, surrendered
on the same day. The regiment of Stanhope, and three
hundred Marines, advanced against Adge, and the
town was delivered up without resistance.</p>

<p>The Isle of Cette was shortly afterwards recovered
by the French army, under the Duke of Roquetaine;
but the British troops had previously re-embarked.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1711</div>

<p>In the early part of the year 1711 it was resolved to
make an attack on the town of <em>Quebec</em>, the capital of
the French possessions in Canada, for which service
Admiral Sir Hovenden Walker and Major-General
John Hill were appointed Commanders-in-Chief;
a large fleet of ships of war formed part of the armament,
which was to be further strengthened by troops
from the American colonies; they were directed to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19a"></a>[19]</span>
proceed to Boston in New England, and to make
arrangements for this undertaking. They reached
Naerlaskel near Boston on the 24th of June, and
having collected the provincial corps, and withdrawn
the Marines from Anna-polis Royal, which had been
occupied by these corps since its surrender in 1709,
they sailed for the object of their destination, after
many delays, on the 30th of July.</p>

<p>The expedition did not reach the River St. Lawrence
until the 21st of August, when it encountered
storms, and being furnished with pilots who were
unacquainted with the navigation of that river, eight
transports, a store ship, and a sloop were lost by
shipwreck, and upwards of eighty persons, including
officers, soldiers, and women, principally belonging to
Colonel Kane’s fourth regiment, and Colonel Clayton’s
thirty-seventh regiment, perished in this fatal service.</p>

<p>A scarcity of provisions had arisen, and it was then determined
by a council of war that further operations
should be abandoned. Some of the corps proceeded
to Anna-polis Royal, and the squadron returned to
England in the month of October, 1711, after having
left the provincial auxiliaries upon their own coast.</p>

<p>On the 17th of April, 1711, the decease of Joseph I.,
Emperor of Germany, occurred, and Charles III., of
Spain, was elected Emperor of Germany at Frankfort,
by the name of Charles IV., on the 12th October
following. Further attempts on the part of the
British Government, in the cause of King Charles
were now unnecessary, as he was called upon to assume
the Imperial throne of his country. His Majesty
embarked at Barcelona, on the 27th of September, on
board of the confederate fleet, and sailed for Italy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1712<br />1713</div>

<p>In the year 1712 negotiations were entered into by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20a"></a>[20]</span>
Great Britain and France, and peace was restored by
the treaty of Utrecht on the 31st of March, 1713. By
this treaty it was settled, that Great Britain should
retain possession of Gibraltar, Minorca, and Nova
Scotia, which had been conquered during the late war,
and in effecting which, the Marine corps, which had
been formed during the reign of Queen Anne, greatly
contributed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1714</div>

<p>On the return of peace, as concluded by the treaty
of Utrecht, in 1713, the corps of Marines, which had
been formed in the reign of Queen Anne, were ordered
to be disbanded; they were considered to be part of a
war establishment, and a spirit of public economy, as
well as of jealousy against a standing army, particularly
in the early periods after the Revolution of 1688,
afforded to the leaders of parliamentary debates, and of
popular prejudices, grounds of objection to the maintaining
of such corps after the termination of hostilities.</p>

<p>The arrangements consequent on the general peace
having been made, a great reduction in the forces
took place. These arrangements had scarcely been
decided, when the decease of Her Majesty Queen
Anne took place on the 1st of August, 1714, and King
George the First ascended the throne.</p>

<p>Soon after His Majesty’s accession, the peace of the
kingdom was disturbed by the hostile designs of King
Louis XV. of France, who had supported and encouraged
James Francis Edward Stuart, son of His late
Majesty King James II., in his endeavours to obtain the
throne of Great Britain; but the loyalty of the people,
and the courage of the troops, defeated the attempts
for the restoration of the Stuart family.</p>

<p>King George I., being supported by the parliament,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21a"></a>[21]</span>
adopted active measures for increasing his army, and
resisting the plans of his enemies. Six additional
regiments of cavalry, from ninth to fourteenth dragoons,
were raised. The establishments of the regiments of
infantry were increased, and in consideration of the
gallant and extensive services of the Marine corps
during the late war, Wills’s, now <em>thirtieth</em>, Goring’s,
now <em>thirty-first</em>, and Borr’s, now <em>thirty-second</em>, were
incorporated with the regiments of infantry of the line,
and ranked according to the dates of their original
formation in 1702.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1739</div>

<p>From the year 1714 to 1739 no corps of Marines,
except four invalid companies, were kept on the establishment
of the army.</p>

<p>For several years Spain had beheld with great
jealousy the growing commerce and increasing naval
consequence of Great Britain, particularly in the
neighbourhood of her possessions in South America,
where Spain had endeavoured to monopolize the whole
commerce and wealth of Mexico and Peru; the vessels
of foreign powers were forbidden, under severe penalties,
to approach within a certain distance of her
American possessions; and to enforce this, the American
seas were filled with Spanish cruisers, whose enormities
at length attracted the attention of the British
parliament. After fruitless representations to the
court of Madrid for redress, the British ministry at
length determined on hostilities; and, with the acclamations
of the nation, war was formally declared
against Spain on the 23rd of October, 1739.</p>

<p>It was again considered necessary to form an efficient
maritime force in distinct regiments, by which means
the corps of the regular army could be embarked when
required for continental services, and the marine regiments<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22a"></a>[22]</span>
could be employed, either on board of ships of
war, or at the naval stations, as might be considered
best for the public service.</p>

<p>Orders were issued for augmenting the land forces,
and also for forming <em>six regiments of marines</em>, each to
consist of ten companies of seventy privates in each
company, and to be commanded by</p>

<p class="noindent pad3 fs90">
1st, Colonel Edward Wolfe, from 3rd Foot Guards;<br />
2nd, Colonel W. Robinson, from Handasyd’s 22nd regiment;<br />
3rd, Colonel Andrew Lowther, from 2nd Foot Guards;<br />
4th, Colonel John Wynyard, from Tyrrell’s regiment;<br />
5th, Colonel Charles Douglas, from Howard’s regiment;<br />
6th, Colonel Lucius Ducie Moreton, from 3rd Foot Guards.<br />
</p>

<p>In order to facilitate the speedy formation of these
corps, and to render them effective, five men from each
company of the regiments of foot guards were appointed
serjeants and corporals; and further, that they might
be rapidly completed, a bounty of thirty shillings per
man was allowed to 1800 men who volunteered from
the regiments of infantry to the marine corps: by
these energies, the whole of the marine regiments were
soon raised and disciplined.</p>

<p>On the prospect of the commencement of hostilities
Admiral Vernon had sailed for Jamaica, where he
arrived in October, 1739, with a fleet of five ships,
having 200 marines on board, and proceeded from
thence to <em>Porto Bello</em>, the destined object of his attach,
which was at that time the great mart for the wealthy
commerce of Chili and Peru; the attempt was fraught
with many difficulties, but it was undertaken and
performed with spirit and promptitude.</p>

<p>On the 21st of November, 1739, the attack was commenced
by the ships, in line of battle, against the Iron
Castle, a strong fort at the north point of the entrance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23a"></a>[23]</span>
into the harbour. The Spaniards flying from several
parts of it, an instant debarkation of the seamen and
marines from on board the Burford, Norwich, and
Worcester took place under cover of those ships, and
the fort was carried. Upon the 22nd an attack was
intended against the whole, but the enemy displayed
the white flag as a signal of surrender. After destroying
the fortifications, which from their strength required
some time, the Admiral with his squadron sailed
for Jamaica on the 13th of December, 1739.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1740</div>

<p>In the year 1740 an additional regiment, of four
battalions, was authorised to be raised in America,
and the royal standard was erected at New York, as
the signal-post to which every volunteer marine was
to repair. The field officers and subalterns were appointed
by the King, and the captains of companies
were nominated by the American provinces. Colonel
Spotswood, of Virginia, was appointed colonel-commandant
of the whole. It was supposed that, from
climate, the natives of that continent were better calculated
for the service to which they were destined,
than Europeans. Their uniform was camblet coats,
brown linen waistcoats, and canvas trousers. This
regiment, which was afterwards commanded by Colonel
Gooche, was considered as the <span class="allsmcap">FORTY-THIRD</span> regiment
of infantry of the line.</p>

<p>In January, 1740, an augmentation of 340 men, and
of one lieutenant in each company, was made in each
of the six regiments of marines, and twenty men were
added to each of the four companies of invalids, and
a similar number to the retired marine establishment.</p>

<p>The utility of the corps of marines was now universally
admitted, and in a letter addressed to the Duke
of Newcastle, then first lord of the treasury and prime<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24a"></a>[24]</span>
minister, by Admiral Vernon, previously to his sailing
with an expedition to the West Indies, he thus expressed
himself on the subject of marine soldiers:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I could wish that we” (alluding to ships of war)
“had each a company of regular troops on board,
which would strengthen us in numbers, and their
expertness in handling their arms would incite our
seamen to the imitation of them. If we should come
to a general war with France as well as Spain, I believe
your Grace will have already perceived, from
the difficulty of manning our ships, the necessity of
converting most of our marching regiments into
marines.</p>

<p>“I have always looked upon our fleet as what must
not only protect our trade, but secure to us the
blessings of a Protestant succession, being strongly
convinced in my own judgment, that preserving a
superiority at sea is the best security of His Majesty’s
government, as well as the trade and prosperity
of this kingdom.”</p>
</div>

<p>The sentiments expressed by Admiral Vernon, in
favour of the marines, were drawn from the acknowledged
usefulness of the corps so employed in the
naval expeditions during the reign of Queen Anne.</p>

<p>In the year 1740 <em>four</em> additional regiments of marines
were raised, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noindent pad3 fs90">
7th, Colonel W. Cornwall; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9th, Colonel C. Powlett;<br />
8th, Colonel W. Hanmore; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10th, Colonel J. Jeffreys.
</p>

<p class="noindent">Each regiment consisted of ten companies of 100
men in each company, which, with officers included,
amounted to 1155 in each regiment. The <em>six</em> regiments
raised in 1739 were increased to the same numbers
of officers and men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25a"></a>[25]</span></p>

<p>In February, 1740, the town of <em>Carthagena</em>, the
capital of an extensive and wealthy province in Terra
Firma in South America, was bombarded, and an
attack was made upon Chagre, a fort situate upon
the mouth of a river of that name a little to the north-west
of the Gulf of Darien. The latter surrendered,
after a sharp contest, on the 24th of March, when the
castle, situated on a rock, and the custom house under
its protection, were demolished and burnt.</p>

<p>These were all that could be performed until the
arrival of reinforcements and supplies from England.
The fleet afterwards returned to Porto Bello, and from
thence to Jamaica.</p>

<p>Considerable exertions were made in England during
the year 1740 with the view of attacking, more effectually,
the Spanish possessions in South America.</p>

<p>A large number of ships of war was assembled at
Spithead under the command of Rear-Admiral Sir
Chaloner Ogle, and a land force, consisting of Harrison’s
(15th) regiment, Wentworth’s (24th) regiment,
and part of Cavendish’s (34th) regiment, was collected
in the Isle of Wight, and held in readiness, with the six
regiments of marines, to be embarked for service under
the orders of General Lord Cathcart, a nobleman of
approved courage and experience in war.</p>

<p>The fleet, with the British armament, consisting of
one hundred and seventy ships, sailed from St. Helen’s
in October, 1740; but being overtaken by a tempest
in the Bay of Biscay, it was dispersed. The greater
part of the vessels, being re-collected, the Admiral
prosecuted his voyage, and anchored at the neutral
island of Dominica, in order to obtain a supply of wood
and water.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for the service, General Lord Cathcart<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26a"></a>[26]</span>
fell an early victim to the disease of the climate,
and the command of the expedition devolved upon
Brigadier-General Thomas Wentworth, of the 24th
regiment.</p>

<p>The sixth regiment of foot, under the command of
Colonel John Guise, who was appointed brigadier-general,
was subsequently ordered to proceed to the
West Indies to reinforce the troops employed in this
enterprise.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1741</div>

<p>The fleet, under the charge of Rear-Admiral Sir
Chaloner Ogle, arrived at Jamaica in January, 1741,
and joined the force under Vice-Admiral Vernon, who
was thus placed at the head of the most formidable
fleet and army which were ever employed in those seas.
The conjoined squadrons consisted of twenty-nine ships
of the line, with nearly an equal number of frigates, fire-ships,
and bomb-ketches, well manned, and plentifully
supplied with provisions, stores, and necessaries. The
number of seamen amounted to 15,000; that of the
land forces, including the American regiment of four
battalions (Colonel Spotswood’s) and a body of negroes
enlisted at Jamaica, did not fall short of 12,000.</p>

<p>The whole force sailed from Irish Bay in Hispaniola,
and anchored on the evening of the 4th of March in the
<em>Grande Playa</em>, to windward of the town of <em>Carthagena</em>,
the intended object of the attack.</p>

<p>The necessary arrangements having been made, the
fleet moved forward in two divisions on the 8th of
March, in order to silence the different forts, preparatory
to the landing of the troops.</p>

<p>After about one hour’s cannonade, the forts of <em>St. Jago</em>
and <em>St. Philip</em> were deserted by the enemy, and were
taken possession of by the troops; and by the 15th all
the soldiers, with their tents, tools, artillery, and stores,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27a"></a>[27]</span>
were landed, the ground cleared, and an encampment
formed.</p>

<p>The reduction of the Castle of <em>Bocca Chica</em> next took
place, which, on a practicable breach being made, it
was determined to storm; but, in consequence of a well-judged
diversion of the navy, the Spaniards retired
without firing a shot, and when the grenadiers advanced
to storm at the hour appointed, they met no resistance.</p>

<p>A panic had seized the enemy, who set fire to one
of their ships; taking advantage of this state, the
boats resolved to attempt the fort of <em>St. Joseph</em>, which
was immediately evacuated. The Spaniards appearing
to be determined to sink their vessels, the British
crews proceeded to board the ship Galicia, which carried
the flag of the Spanish Admiral.</p>

<p>After various services the castle of <em>Grande Castello</em>
was gained, and the enemy had sunk all their ships of
war; preparations were made for landing the troops
near the town, in order to cut off all communication
with the main land.</p>

<p>Two channels having been made through the sunk
vessels, with which the Spaniards had blocked up the
entrance of the harbour, the troops and artillery were
re-embarked, and commenced landing on the 5th of
April near the city; and, after a spirited contest, the
British bivouacked within a mile of the castle of <em>St.
Lazar</em>, which commanded the town. The men passed
three nights in the open air for want of tents and tools,
which could not be landed sooner, and the health of
the troops became seriously injured.</p>

<p>As affairs were now drawing to extremities, and the
men were fast diminishing in numbers from hard duty
and the effects of climate, Brigadier-General Wentworth
resolved to attack <em>St. Lazar</em> by escalade, it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28a"></a>[28]</span>
being judged necessary to forego the ceremonies of a
regular siege, and, however hazardous, to rest the issue
upon a storm.</p>

<p>Accordingly before daybreak on the 9th of April,
a force under the command of Brigadier-General Guise,
of the sixth foot, consisting of five hundred grenadiers,
supported by a thousand Marines, and some American
and Jamaican levies, advanced against the enemy’s
lines in front of the fort; these were followed by a
body of Americans, with woolpacks, scaling-ladders
and hand-grenades.</p>

<p>The grenadiers, led by Colonel Grant, of the fifth
Marines, rushed forward with astonishing bravery, and,
leaping into the entrenchments, carried the works in
gallant style, driving the Spaniards into the fort over
a drawbridge which communicated with the lines.
Colonel Grant fell mortally wounded, and the troops,
after sustaining a most destructive fire for several
hours with intrepidity and perseverance, were ordered
to retreat, having lost many officers, and 600 men in
killed and wounded.</p>

<p>This repulse was succeeded by the violent periodical
rains; the country was deluged with water; and the
change of atmosphere, which is always attended with
epidemical diseases, produced the most fatal effects.
The troops were so drenched with rain, and their health
so seriously impaired, that all hope of further success
vanished; they were accordingly re-embarked, and the
forts and castle of the harbour of <em>Carthagena</em> having
been demolished, the fleet sailed for Jamaica on the
6th of May, where it arrived on the 9th of that month.
After re-embarking, the distempers, peculiar to the
climate, produced numerous casualties among the troops.</p>

<p>Thus terminated, for the time, the expedition to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29a"></a>[29]</span>
Spanish South America, during which the persevering
and undaunted bravery of British Seamen, Soldiers,
and Marines, and their patient endurance under the
most trying difficulties, were never displayed in a
greater degree.</p>

<p>In consequence of the heavy losses sustained at
<em>Carthagena</em>, and the mortality which continued to
prevail after the troops returned to Jamaica, it was
not until the beginning of July, 1741, that the fleet
and army were in a condition to renew their operations.
It was then resolved to proceed against the <em>Island of
Cuba</em>, where they anchored on the 18th of July in
Waltenham Bay, about eighteen leagues to windward
of <em>St. Jago</em>, the first object of their intended attack.
The troops were landed on the 24th, consisting of
nearly 4,000 men, including 1000, negroes raised by
the Island of Jamaica, with a view to sustain the
peculiar duties of fatigue, naturally expected to arise
on this service.</p>

<p>After establishing a position on the side of the river,
nearly three leagues from the mouth of the harbour,
the General pushed some detachments into the country,
which beat back the outposts of the enemy, and in a
few days returned to the camp with plentiful supplies
of provisions.</p>

<p>It was originally intended by the Commanders-in-Chief
to have made a joint attack upon <em>St. Jago</em>, but
the want of unanimity ruined every purpose, and contentious
debates and dilatory measures, instead of cordial
co-operation and daring enterprise, took place; while
the interests of the country, and the lives of the troops,
were sacrificed to the prejudices and bad judgment of
the officers entrusted with so important a command.</p>

<p>After an interval of several months, during which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30a"></a>[30]</span>
nothing was attempted towards effecting the conquest
of the island, and when sickness, the never-failing
result of inactivity, particularly in those climes, began
its ravages, it was determined to evacuate the island,
which took place on the 20th of November, 1741, when
the regimental Returns were as follow:&mdash;</p>

<p>The total loss of officers at the close of 1741 amounted
to one Commander-in-Chief, five colonels, ten lieut.-colonels,
seven majors, fifty-five captains, one hundred
and sixteen subalterns, and fourteen staff officers.</p>

<p>The heavy casualties in the Marine regiments are
shown when it is stated that these six regiments consisted
of more than one thousand men each, and that, only
2654 men returned.</p>

<p>The foregoing statement affords a sad record of the
ill-judged plans relating to the expedition to South
America, both as to the season of the year at which it
was undertaken, and the deficiency of means and
arrangements with which it was attempted to be carried
into execution. Great disappointment and dissatisfaction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31a"></a>[31]</span>
were consequently created in the feelings of the
British public.</p>

<p>The transports returned to Jamaica on the 29th of
November, 1741, and the squadron continued at sea to
meet the reinforcements which were anxiously expected
from England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1742</div>

<p>In January 1742, nearly 3000 men, including 2000
Marines, arrived at Jamaica. Another expedition
was now meditated, which put to sea early in March;
but adverse winds, the separation of the transports
having on board the working negroes, and the expectation
of the periodical rains being then about to
set in, suggested to a Council of War, held at Porto
Bello, at the close of that month, the immediate
return of the whole armament to the port they had
left: the fleet arrived at Jamaica upon the 15th of May.</p>

<p>It was now considered desirable to detach a force
to take possession of <em>Rattan</em>, an island in the Bay of
Honduras, and a situation proper for maintaining a
commercial intercourse with South America, as well
as the trade in logwood. An establishment having
been formed there in the early part of the year, it
was determined in a Council of War to send a force
of 50 marines and 200 Americans, under Major Caulfield,
in order to place the island in a state of military
defence.</p>

<p>On the 23rd of August the troops reached <em>Port
Royal</em>, on the south side of the island, where they formed
a camp and erected <em>Fort George</em> to defend the harbour,
as well as <em>Fort Frederick</em> on the western part of it.
A proportion of the Americans, who were papists,
formed a plot to render the settlement abortive, and
to rise upon the Marines. Her Majesty’s ship, the
Litchfield, then in the harbour, hearing the alarm-guns,
instantly landed her party of Marines, who,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32a"></a>[32]</span>
with those on shore, soon checked the daring mutiny,
secured the delinquents, and preserved the settlement
to the British Crown.</p>

<p>At this period it was necessary to detach 500 men
to the assistance of <em>General Oglethorpe</em>, in <em>South Carolina</em>,
and to repel the menaces of the Spaniards
against the infant colony of <em>Georgia</em>.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>On the 23rd of September orders arrived at Jamaica
for <ins class="corr" id="tnm-32" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'the recal of'">
the recall of</ins> Admiral Vernon and of General
Wentworth; for providing the fleet with a number
of men from the Marines, sufficient to supply its
wants; and also to fill up the vacancies in the eight
Independent Companies raised for the defence of
Jamaica (now the 49th Regiment):&mdash;These services
absorbed all the men who were considered fit for
duty, and the remainder were embarked for England.</p>

<p>After the departure of Admiral Vernon, the Naval
Command devolved on Sir Chaloner Ogle, who bore
his testimony to the zeal and bravery of the troops,
whose gallant efforts and patient endurance, under
great privations, had been conspicuous throughout a
series of misfortunes. Upwards of 7000 Marines and
nearly 4000 other troops were the lamentable victims
to pestilence and disease, but not to defeat; and the
objects which had been effected, although not adequate
to the hopes and expectations of the British Nation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33a"></a>[33]</span>
were distressing to the enemy, and embarrassing to
the Spanish Government.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1743</div>

<p>In the early part of 1743 it was resolved to make
another attempt upon the continent of South America,
and the conduct of the operations was entrusted to
Captain Knowles, of the Navy, who had on board of
his squadron 400 of <em>Dalzell’s</em> (thirty-eighth) <em>regiment</em>
and about <em>six hundred Marines</em>. They were first
ordered to rendezvous at Antigua, from which island
they sailed on the 12th of February with a view to an
attack upon La Guira, a town in the district of the
Caraccas in Terra Firma. The attack was commenced
on the 18th, but, owing to a heavy swell, the ships
could not approach the shore, and the troops were consequently
not landed. After a heavy cannonade, which
was ended only by the night, the ships withdrew from
the combat: the town suffered extremely, many breaches
being made in the fortifications; and the enemy
sustained a loss of more than 700 men. The British
squadron suffered considerable damage, and had
nearly 400 men killed and wounded.</p>

<p>The fleet proceeded <ins class="corr" id="tnm-33" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'to Curaçoa to'">
to Curaçao to</ins> refit, where preparations
were made for another attempt upon the
sea-coast of Terra Firma. Having been reinforced by
some Dutch volunteers, Commodore Knowles sailed
from this island on the 20th of March, and steered for
<em>Porto Cavallo</em>, a town having a respectable force, and
being in a good state of defence.</p>

<p>On the 15th of April the ships anchored to the eastward
of the town, and on the 16th two vessels commenced
a flanking fire against <em>Ponta Brava</em>; and after
the batteries were silenced, it was decided to land the
troops in order to take possession, and to turn the guns
against the castle, their retreat being secured by a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34a"></a>[34]</span>
ship of war within pistol-shot, of the shore: by sunset
the ships had accomplished their object, and by dusk
a force of 1200 sailors, soldiers, and Dutch volunteers,
was disembarked under the command of Major
Lucas.</p>

<p>About eleven at night the van had gained one of
the fascine batteries upon Ponta Brava, but the
garrison having been alarmed, and being prepared
for resistance, this mixed detachment acted under the
influence of a panic, and retreated with precipitation
to the ships. On the 21st it was resolved to make
another attack of the squadron and forces against the
castle and fascine batteries: four ships were destined
to batter the former on the 24th, while three others
were placed against the latter. The cannonading
began at eleven on the noon of that day, and was
maintained with mutual obstinacy till night, when,
some of the ships having expended their ammunition,
and others being damaged, they were ordered to
anchor beyond reach of the enemy’s shot. This attack
being fruitless, and the troops being prevented from
landing, it was deemed impracticable to push the
enterprise any further: it was accordingly resolved
on the 28th of April to return to Jamaica.</p>

<p>From the period of the commencement of hostilities
against Spain in 1739, the conduct of the Court of
Versailles had been equivocal, and in the beginning
of the year 1743 the projects of Louis XV. were
developed by the equipment of powerful naval armaments
in the ports of France, and by the assembling
of armies on the sea-coasts, the avowed aim of which
was against the Crown and liberties of the British
Empire.</p>

<p>Being no longer able to restrain her views, France<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35a"></a>[35]</span>
declared war on the 20th of March, 1743, which was
answered by a proclamation on the part of Great
Britain on the 31st of that month.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1744</div>

<p>A force of 11,550 Marines was granted by Parliament
as a part of the establishment for the year 1744,
at which period fleets were detached to every quarter
of the globe. A partial affair occurred in the Mediterranean
in May of this year, in which a party of
Marines disembarked from the Essex ship-of-war, and
signalized themselves: that ship being on a cruise
gained sight of twenty-six xebeques and settees,
bound to Antibes, from whence they were to carry
troops to Italy: the former were a convoy to the latter,
which were laden with powder, cannon, ordnance stores,
and provisions: thirteen having taken refuge in the
Creek of Casse, the Marines were landed in order to
co-operate with the boats, and to repel any enemy that
might appear to retard their progress: they were
attacked by a body of Spaniards, whom they beat
back, and thus effected the object on which they were
employed: eleven vessels were burnt and two captured.</p>

<p>The most active measures were adopted, by order
of the Secretary at War, for again completing the ten
regiments of Marines, in order to render them effective
as speedily as possible.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1745</div>

<p>Attacks having been made during the last year by
the French upon <em>Canso</em> and <em>Anna-polis</em> in <em>Nova Scotia</em>,
the former of which they burnt, the Northern Colonies
of British America became alarmed for their safety:
an expedition was consequently commenced against
<em>Louisburg</em>; considerable levies were raised in the
American provinces, and a co-operating naval force,
under Commodore Warren, then commanding on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36a"></a>[36]</span>
West India station, was ordered to repair to Canso;
the arrangements made for conducting this expedition
were carried into effect with that confidence and
secrecy which are always essential towards securing
the success of a military enterprise, and the exertions
of the Americans were fully equal to the important
interests which they had at stake.</p>

<p>On the 4th of April the levies from New England,
having reached <em>Canso</em>, were encamped and brought
into military order and discipline preparatory to the
arrival of other corps from the several provinces,
while the ships of war upon the coast, and some stout
privateers, continued off the harbour of <em>Louisburg</em>, in
order to cut off all intelligence of the projected enterprise.
On the 23rd of April Commodore Warren
arrived at <em>Canso</em>, and by the 29th all the land forces
were embarked, and proceeded to <em>Gabaras Bay</em>, about
four miles from the capital of <em>Cape Breton</em>.</p>

<p>On the 30th of April 2000 men were landed at noon,
who beat back a detachment of troops which was sent
to prevent their disembarkation. On that and the
following day three hundred seamen and <em>five hundred
Marines</em> were disembarked under cover of the vessels
ranged along the coast. The troops were under the
command of Brigadier-General William Pepperell, a
native of Piccataway, and Colonel of American Militia.</p>

<p>The French, conscious of the strength of their
positions, maintained possession of the city until their
means of defence were overpowered by the forces
brought against them.</p>

<p>By indefatigable labour, the British Marines, and
the American provincials, succeeded in effecting an
entrance into the harbour on the 1st of June, 1745;
<em>Louisburg</em> capitulated, and with it the whole dependency<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37a"></a>[37]</span>
of <em>Cape Breton</em>; the object was attained with a
loss little exceeding 100 men.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>Two regiments were formed for service at Cape
Breton, by Colonel William Shirley and Sir William
Pepperell, each consisting of ten companies of 100
men per company: these were numbered the 50th and
51st regiments of infantry of the line.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1746</div>

<p>In the year 1746 very serious complaints were
made of the neglect and delay which had occurred in
the settlement of the accounts of the Marine Corps,
and a committee was appointed to investigate the
grievances which had been represented. The cause
of the delay was alleged to arise, in the first instance,
from the absence of regular and periodical muster-rolls,
according to the practice in regiments of the
regular army. This system, it was stated, could
not easily be acted upon in the corps of Marines,
who were employed by detachments in the several
ships of war. The investigation produced, however,
the effect of a large balance in the hands of the Paymaster-General
being repaid into the Bank of England,
for the benefit of those who were justly entitled to it.</p>

<p>The privations and inconveniences, which this meritorious
body of troops had continued to endure for
several years, did not affect their loyalty and steady
allegiance, and they still remained the useful corps,
in periods of emergency, they had always proved in
former years.</p>

<p>For the service of this year (1746) nearly 12,000
Marines were included in the parliamentary vote of
the military establishment. An expedition against<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38a"></a>[38]</span>
Quebec was contemplated at this period, and a considerable
force was assembled at Spithead with that intent,
but delays took place until the season for such an attempt
became too late. Of this force Colonel Powlett’s
(the ninth) regiment of Marines formed a part.</p>

<p>The troops were afterwards destined against <em>Port
L’Orient</em>, under the directions of Admiral Lestock
and Lieut.-General Sinclair. Sixteen sail of the line
and eight frigates, with 5000 troops, exclusive of
Marines, were the number employed on this occasion.
The long detention of so respectable a force until the
period of the equinox, endangered its progress along a
hostile coast at so critical a season, and gave time for
the enemy to ascertain the object of the expedition.</p>

<p>The fleet sailed from Plymouth on the 14th of
September for the coast of Brittany, and a debarkation
of the troops was effected on the 20th of that
month, in <em>Quimperlay Bay</em>: on the 21st the troops
advanced in two columns against <em>Plymeur</em>, which
surrendered, and on the following day the whole
moved on to a rising ground within a mile of <em>Port
L’Orient</em>, the ultimate object of their views. Some
affairs took place between the 21st and 26th of September,
when after a cannonade, which did considerable
damage to the town, a retreat was commenced
under cover of the night. The French were
pouring in from all quarters, and the situation of the
British troops became critical.</p>

<p>After a loss of 150 men killed, wounded, and
missing, a re-embarkation was effected, and the fleet
sailed on the 1st of October for the Bay of Borneuff,
off Quiberon, to the south of Quimperlay: a detachment
of Marines was entrenched at Quimperlay to
guard the landing-place; the remainder, under Colonel
Holmes, was united with the army: some troops were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39a"></a>[39]</span>
landed on the 4th of October on the peninsula of
Quiberon, and, after remaining ashore some days,
the whole returned to England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1747</div>

<p>The number of Marines for the year 1747 was
eleven thousand one hundred and fifty, as included in
the parliamentary vote of that year.</p>

<p>On the 28th of February, 1747, His Majesty King
George II. directed, that the several regiments of
Marines, which were then existing, or might hereafter
be raised, should be placed under the entire command
of the Lords Commissioners for executing the office of

preceding year (1746), when Louis XV. had equipped
an extensive armament, under the command of the
Duke d’Anville for the recapture of Cape Breton,
which was rendered ineffectual by storms and other
casualties, and by the death of its commander, the
French Monarch was not discouraged by these disasters;
but was resolved to renew his efforts against
the British colonies in North America, and also the
settlements in the East Indies. For these purposes
two squadrons were prepared at Brest, one commanded
by Commodore de la Jonquière, and the other, destined
for India, by Monsieur de St. George.</p>

<p>Intelligence had been received by the British Government
of these preparations, and measures were
adopted in order to counteract the views of the enemy.
The occasion afforded a renewed display of the zeal
and intrepidity of Vice-Admiral Anson and Rear-Admiral<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41a"></a>[41]</span>
Warren, who sailed from Plymouth on the
9th of April, in order to intercept both squadrons,
which were to set sail together. The Vice-Admiral, on
board of the “Prince George” of ninety guns, with the
Rear-Admiral, on board the “Devonshire,” and twelve
ships more under his command, received directions <ins class="corr" id="tnm-41" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'to cruize between'">
to cruise between</ins> Ushant and Cape Finisterre on the
coast of Galicia.</p>

<p>On the 3rd of May, 1747, they fell in with the French
squadrons, consisting of six large ships of war, as many
frigates, and four armed vessels equipped by the French
East India Company, having under their convoy about
thirty ships laden with merchandize: those prepared
for war immediately shortened sail, and formed in line
of battle, while the rest, under the protection of the six
frigates, proceeded on their voyage with all the sail they
could carry. The British squadron was likewise drawn
up in line of battle, and the engagement began with
great fury about four o’clock in the afternoon. The
enemy’s ships sustained the battle with equal conduct
and valour, until they were overpowered by numbers,
and they then struck their colours. About seven
hundred of the French were killed and wounded in
this action; the English lost about five hundred; and
among them Captain Grenville, Commander of the ship
“Defiance,” nephew to Lord Viscount Cobham, an
officer of the most promising genius, and animated with
the noblest sentiments of honour and patriotism. Two
of these prizes were the “<i>Invincible</i>” and the “<i>Glory</i>,”
which induced the Captain of the former to say to the
Admiral, on giving up his sword, “Sir, you have conquered
the <em>Invincible</em>, and <em>Glory</em> follows you.” This
blow was severely felt by France, who had vainly flattered
herself, that by means of this armament she should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42a"></a>[42]</span>
render herself mistress of the Indian seas, and by that
superiority be enabled to wrest from the British their
most valuable possessions in that part of the world.</p>

<p>A considerable quantity of money, intended to answer
the contingencies of these expeditions, was found on
board of the French ships, which were brought to
Spithead, and the treasure, being landed, was conveyed
in twenty waggons to the Bank of England, escorted
by a party of Marines, amidst the acclamations of the
populace.</p>

<p>For this achievement Vice-Admiral George Anson
was created a Peer of Great Britain, and Rear-Admiral
Peter Warren was invested with the Order of the Bath.
The whole fleet received the thanks of the Sovereign,
through their Commander, Admiral Lord Anson.</p>

<p>The year 1747 was remarkable for other naval successes;
about the middle of June, <span class="smcap">Commodore Fox</span>,
with six ships of war, <ins class="corr" id="tnm-42" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'cruizing in the'">
cruising in the</ins> latitude of Cape
Ortegal, in Galicia, took about forty French ships,
richly laden from St. Domingo, after they had been
abandoned by their convoy.</p>

<p>The fourteenth of October, 1747, was rendered
memorable as another day of triumph for the British
Navy. <span class="smcap">Rear-Admiral Edward Hawke</span> sailed from
Plymouth in the beginning of August, with fourteen
ships of the line, with instructions to intercept a
fleet of French merchant-ships bound for the West
Indies: the British fleet <ins class="corr" id="tnm-42a" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: 'cruized for some'">
cruised for some</ins> time on the coast of Bretagne, and the French ships sailed
from the isle of Aix under convoy of nine ships
of the line, besides frigates, commanded by M. de
l’Etendiere. The two squadrons came in sight of
each other in the latitude of Belle Isle. The battle
commenced about eleven in the forenoon, and lasted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43a"></a>[43]</span>
until night, when all the French squadron, except two
ships, the “Intrepide” and “Tonnant,” which escaped
in the dark, had struck to the English flag. After
despatching a sloop to Commodore Legge, commanding
a squadron in the Leeward Islands, to take proper
measures to intercept the French ships in the passage
to Martinique, and other French islands, <span class="smcap">Admiral
Hawke</span> conducted his prizes to Spithead, and was
rewarded with the Order of the Bath; and the thanks
of a grateful country were rendered to all the officers,
seamen, and Marines of the squadron.</p>

<p>In the latter part of 1747, <em>Admiral Boscawen</em> had
sailed from England with a fleet of ships, and a number
of Marines, and other forces, in order to reinforce the
British fleet in the East Indies, with instructions to
make an attack upon the <em>Island of Mauritius</em>, and subsequently
to effect the conquest of <em>Pondicherry</em>, which
was the chief object of the expedition.</p>

<p>After having reconnoitred the coast of the Mauritius,
it was ascertained that the powerful means of defence
everywhere presented, and the dangers in many
places of approaching the land, would involve a great
sacrifice of men, and render success ultimately doubtful;
the coming on of the autumnal monsoons had
also an influence in the decision of a council, which
was to relinquish the attempt, and to proceed without
delay for the <em>Coast of Coromandel</em>, according to the
prescribed plan of operations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1748</div>

<p>About the end of June, 1748, the Admiral quitted
the Coasts of the Mauritius, and proceeded to <em>Fort St.
David</em>, where the troops were landed, and encamped
with all the necessary stores; the Marines from four
ships sent to Europe under Admiral Griffin, were
added to the battalion employed on this service. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44a"></a>[44]</span>
forces employed amounted to six thousand British
and Native Auxiliary troops, and upwards of one
thousand sailors, trained to the use of small arms,
who were to form the besieging army. The battering
cannon, mortars, and every implement were conveyed
by the squadron within two miles of the town,
while the land forces marched on the 8th of August
towards <em>Pondicherry</em>, about thirty miles distant.</p>

<p>After several unsuccessful attempts, the troops
crossed the river of <em>Arian Coupan</em>, and obtained possession
of a strong situation within a mile of that Fort;
a communication was maintained from thence with the
fleet; and all the implements necessary for the siege
were landed.</p>

<p>On the 25th of September the batteries were completed,
and began to play; but, notwithstanding a
combined cannonade on the part of the squadron against
the town, it was found that the enemy’s fire gained an
ascendency over the besiegers. The fatigues endured
by the troops, sickness becoming prevalent, and the
rainy season being daily expected, which would inundate
the country, and render retreat impracticable,
afforded strong grounds, on which a Council of War,
held on the 30th of September, determined to abandon
the siege, to re-embark the men and stores, and to
destroy the batteries. The troops fortunately reached
Fort St. David on the evening of the 7th of October,
after having demolished the fort of <em>Arian Coupan</em> on
their way; the heavy rains which fell on the same
evening had nearly rendered the rivers impassable.</p>

<p>On the 13th of February, 1748, the British squadron
in the West Indies sailed from Jamaica under the
command of Rear-Admiral Knowles, on an expedition
against St. Jago, in Cuba, for which purpose some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45a"></a>[45]</span>
land forces were embarked at Jamaica, and being joined
with the Marines of the squadron, the whole put to
sea; but after persevering for some time against strong
northerly winds, which prevented their approaching
that coast, the design was given up, and the force was
directed against <em>Port Louis</em>, on the south side of Hispaniola,
before which place it arrived on the 8th of
March. The service was performed by the ships in
line of battle, which, after three hours’ heavy cannonade,
compelled the governor, M. de Chaleaunoye,
to surrender, when Major Scott, with a detachment of
Colonel Trelawny’s, the forty-ninth regiment, and the
Marines, were landed, and took possession of the Fort
in the name of His Majesty. After having shipped
or destroyed upwards of eighty heavy cannon, and
blown up the works, the whole were re-embarked; and
Rear-Admiral Knowles resumed his former design
against St. Jago, where he arrived on the 5th of April.
The Plymouth and Cornwall were ordered to enter
the harbour, but after firing a few broadsides at the
castle, it was considered prudent to desist, and the
squadron returned to Jamaica.</p>

<p>The distresses of France arising from the destruction
of her Navy, and the annihilation of her commerce,
compelled King Louis XV. to express a desire for
peace. Accordingly, a congress was held at <em>Aix-la-Chapelle</em>,
in order to negotiate the terms on which peace
could be restored. The desire expressed by the King
of France, as well as of Spain, did not, however, induce
the British Government to relax in its efforts to reduce
the means which those powers never failed to use,
when opportunities offered, of thwarting the measures
of Great Britain.</p>

<p>The negotiations, commenced at Aix-la-Chapelle in
June, 1748, produced a Definitive Treaty of Peace,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46a"></a>[46]</span>
which was concluded on the 18th of October of that
year, and was proclaimed on the 2nd of February, 1749.</p>

<p>Among the many reductions which took place during
1748, consequent on the General Peace, the Ten regiments
of Marines were disbanded in November of that
year, the officers of which were placed on half-pay.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1755</div>

<p>The conditions of the Peace concluded with France
in 1748, were broken as soon as that Power had recovered
from the effects of the former war: the interval
of six years had been devoted to extending her Naval
preparations, and to negotiations with other States, in
order to reduce, or destroy, the power of Great Britain.</p>

<p>After enduring many insults, and witnessing the
hostile measures which were preparing in the ports
of France, the energies of the British nation were
again aroused, and in the spring of 1755 considerable
augmentations were made in the Army and Navy, and
fifty companies of Marines were directed to be raised
and placed under the control of the Lords Commissioners
of the Admiralty. These companies were
formed into three Divisions, and stationed at Chatham,
Portsmouth, and Plymouth, and an Act of Parliament
was passed for the “Regulation of the Marine forces
while on shore.”<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>From the 5th of April, 1755, the Marine corps have
constituted a branch of the permanent national force,
and have been provided for in the annual votes of the
House of Commons, on distinct estimates produced
at each session, of the Navy, Army, and Marines.</p>


<p class="p2">War was declared against France on the 18th May
in the following year (1756).</p>

<p>The foregoing pages contain accounts of the services
of the <em>Corps of Marines</em> from the earliest period of
their formation, to the year 1748, when they ceased to
form a portion of the establishment of the Army.
These historical details afford numerous instances
in which the gallant exertions of the Marines have
materially contributed to the successes obtained by the
Navy and Army, and to the honours and advantages
which have resulted from their combined operations.</p>

<p>The services of the present Marine forces have
been, as in former years, highly useful and efficient,
and by their uniformly good conduct they have obtained
the approbation of the Sovereign, and the
confidence of the Country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1802</div>

<p>As a lasting mark of approbation, His Majesty King
George III. was pleased, in 1802, to direct that they
should be styled “<em>The Royal Marines</em>,” as announced
in the following Order, issued by the Lords Commissioners
of the Admiralty, and inserted in the London
Gazette, dated</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">“<em>Admiralty Office, 29th April, 1802.</em></p>

<p>“His Majesty has been graciously pleased to signify
His Commands, that, in consideration of the very meritorious
services of the Marines during the late War,
the Corps shall in future be styled ‘<span class="smcap">The Royal
Marines</span>.’</p>

<span class="padr4">“By Command of their Lordships.</span><br />

<p>On acquiring the title of <em>Royal</em>, the facings of the

as in other Royal corps of Infantry.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>On the 26th of September, 1827, New Colours were
presented to the Division of Royal Marines at Chatham,
on the part of His Majesty King George IV.,
by His Royal Highness the Duke of Clarence, then
Lord High Admiral of Great Britain, and General of
Marines, afterwards King William IV.</p>

<p>After alluding to the services of Marine regiments
from the period of their formation to the present time,
His Royal Highness caused the New Colours to be
unfurled, and concluded his address in the following
terms:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“His Majesty has selected for the Royal Marines a
<em>Device</em>, to which their achievements have entitled
them, and which, by his permission, I this day present
to you;&mdash;a <em>Badge</em> which you have so hardly
and honorably earned:&mdash;From the difficulty of
selecting any particular places to inscribe on these
Standards, your Sovereign has been pleased to adopt
‘<em>The Great Globe itself</em>,’ as the most proper and
distinctive badge. He has also directed, that
his own name (<em>George IV.</em>) shall be added to that
peculiar badge, <span class="smcap">The Anchor</span>, which is your distinctive
bearing, in order that it may be known hereafter,
that <span class="smcap">George the Fourth</span> had conferred on you the
honorable and well-earned badge this day presented
to you.</p>

<p>“The motto, peculiarly your own, ‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Per Mare; Per
Terram</i>,’ has been allowed to remain; and surmounting
the entire is the word <span class="smcap">Gibraltar</span>, in commemoration
of the important national services you performed
there. In presenting these Colours, the gift
of your Sovereign, into your hands, I trust,&mdash;I am
confident,&mdash;you will defend them with the same intrepidity,
loyalty, and regard for the interests of the
country, that have marked your preservation of your
old ones; and if you do, your Sovereign, and your
Country, will have equal reason to be satisfied.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_44" href="#FNanchor_44" class="label">[44]</a> By Order in Council, dated 26th October, 1604, it was directed,
that twelve hundred land-soldiers should be raised, in order to be in
readiness for distribution in His Majesty’s fleets; the whole to form
one regiment, of six companies, under a Colonel, with a Lieutenant-Colonel,
and Serjeant-Major; each company consisted of two hundred
soldiers, with a captain, lieutenant, ensign, drummer, four serjeants,
and four corporals. The regiment was armed with firelocks.</p>

<p>A subsequent Order in Council, dated 1st April, 1668, authorised the
drawing of such numbers of soldiers from the Foot Guards, for His
Majesty’s service at sea, during the summer, as the Lord High Admiral
might require.</p>

settlement in <em>Georgia</em>, situated to the southward of <em>Carolina</em> in America,
and <em>Mr. James Oglethorpe</em>, General and Governor of the Province,
embarked at Gravesend with a number of poor families to plant that
Colony. In 1737, when the King of Spain claimed as part of his territories,
the Colony of Georgia, which was considered to belong to Great
Britain, General Oglethorpe was authorised to raise a regiment of six companies
of 100 men each, for the defence of the settlement. The colonies

<p class="noindent">The following memoranda are appended to this narrative of
the services of the Royal Marines, in order to show the relative
positions in which the Marine regiments were placed, in
respect to <em>rank and precedence</em>, with the regiments of Infantry,
during the period the Marine regiments were borne on the
establishment of the regular army, and the ground on which
the present corps of Royal Marines have been authorised,
when acting with the infantry of the line, to take their station
next to the <em>Forty-ninth</em> regiment, according to the date
of their formation in the year 1755, as shown in the following
pages.</p>

<p>The rank of the several regiments of the British army was
first regulated by a Board of General Officers assembled in
the Netherlands, by command of King William III., on the
10th June, 1694.</p>

<p>Another Board of General Officers was assembled by order
of Queen Anne, in 1713, to decide on the rank and precedence
of regiments raised subsequently to 1694.</p>

<p>A third Board was assembled, by command of King
George I., in 1715, for the same purpose.</p>

<p>These Boards recommended that English regiments raised
in England, should take rank from the dates of their formation,
and that English, Scots, and Irish regiments, raised for
the service of a foreign power, should take rank from the dates
of their being placed on the English establishment.</p>

<p>The <em>Numerical Titles</em> of regiments, as fixed on the principle
laid down in the reports of the Boards of General
Officers, above alluded to, were confirmed by the warrant
issued by authority of King George II., dated 1st July, 1751,&mdash;and
also by the warrant of King George III., dated 19th
December, 1768, previously to which periods regiments were
generally designated by the names of their Colonels.</p>

<p>1. The principle on which the Numerical Titles of regiments
were fixed, having been thus established by Royal
authority, the regiments of infantry which had been formed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50a"></a>[50]</span>
by King Charles II., on his Restoration to the Throne in 1660,
and those which had been subsequently raised in the reigns of
King James II. and of William III., were numbered according
to the dates of being placed on the English establishment,&mdash;from
the <em>First</em>, or <em>Royal</em>, regiment to the <em>Twenty-seventh</em>
regiment.</p>

<p>2. The regiments of infantry, which had been added to the
army in the reign of Queen Anne from the year 1702, and
retained on the establishment after the Peace of Utrecht in
1713, commenced with the <em>Twenty-eighth</em>, and ended with the
<em>Thirty-ninth</em> regiment.</p>

<p>3. The <em>Fortieth</em> regiment was formed in the year 1717,
from independent companies in North America and the
West Indies:&mdash;the command was conferred on Colonel
Richard Philips.</p>

<p>4. The <em>Forty-first</em> regiment was formed from Invalids in
1719:&mdash;the command was conferred on Colonel Edmund
Fielding.</p>

<p>5. The other regiments of infantry, raised by King George I.
on the augmentation of the army in the year 1715, were disbanded
in 1718, after the Monarchy, in the line of the House
of Brunswick, had been established, and the Peace of the
Kingdom restored.</p>

<p>6. The <em>Forty-second Highland</em> regiment was formed in the
reign of King George II. from independent companies in
Scotland, in the year 1739. It was originally termed “<em>The
Black Watch</em>” and was placed on the establishment on the
25th October, 1739:&mdash;the command was conferred on Colonel
James Earl of Crawford.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>7. The <em>Forty-third</em> regiment was raised for service in
America, in the year 1740, by Colonel Andrew Spotswood,
and afterwards commanded by Colonel W. Gooche. It was
disbanded in 1743.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51a"></a>[51]</span></p>

<p>8. The Ten regiments of Marines raised in 1739 and 1740,
were numbered from the 44th to the 53rd regiments, as shown
in the following list, viz.:&mdash;</p>

of two companies of one of the regiments raised in the reign
of Queen Anne, which had remained at Jamaica, and of six
other companies formed in that colony. The command was
given to Colonel Edward Trelawny, then Governor of
Jamaica. It was retained on the establishment after the
peace of 1748, and numbered the 49th regiment.</p>

<p>11. On the recommencement of hostilities with France in
1755, fifty companies of Marines were raised, under the
direction and control of the Lords Commissioners of the
Admiralty. These companies were formed into <em>three divisions</em>,
at the principal naval stations, Portsmouth, Plymouth,
and Chatham.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> The <em>Corps of Marines</em> having been raised in

<p>After the peace of Fontainebleau, in 1763, reductions were
made in the regular army, and the number of regiments of
infantry was limited to <span class="smcap">Seventy</span>. The above 71st, 72nd,
73rd, 74th, and 75th Regiments were consequently disbanded
in that year.</p>

<p>15. The number of regiments of infantry continued at
<em>Seventy</em>, until the commencement of the American War in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54a"></a>[54]</span>
1775, and the renewal of hostilities with France and Spain in
1779, when it was increased to <em>One hundred and Five</em> regiments,
exclusive of <em>Eleven</em> unnumbered regiments, and thirty-six
independent companies of Invalids.</p>

<p>16. After the General Peace in 1782 the number of regiments
of infantry was again reduced.</p>

<p>17. In consequence of an increase of possessions in India,
and of additional troops being necessary for the suppression
of certain native powers, which were hostile to the British
Government, additional corps were raised and embarked for
the East Indies in 1779, and in subsequent years.</p>

<p>18. The present <em>Seventy-first</em> regiment was raised in December,
1777, and embarked for India in 1779. Its number
was changed from 73rd to 71st regiment in 1786.</p>

<p>19. The present <em>Seventy-second</em> regiment was raised in
December, 1777, and embarked for India in 1781. Its number
was changed from 78th to 72nd regiment in 1786.</p>

<p>20. The <em>Seventy-third</em> regiment was raised as the second
battalion of the forty-second (Highland) regiment, in 1777,
and embarked for India in 1781. It was formed into a distinct
regiment, and numbered the 73rd (Highland) in 1786.</p>

<p>21. The 74th (Highland), 75th (Highland), 76th, and
77th regiments were raised for service in India in October,
1787, and embarked for India in 1788.</p>

<p>22. The 78th (Highland), 79th (Highland), 80th, 81st,
82nd, 83rd, 84th, 85th, 86th, 87th, 88th, 89th, 90th, and
91st (Highland) regiments were raised in 1793, immediately
after the commencement of the war with France, occasioned
by the revolutionary and violent proceedings in that country
in 1793.</p>

<p>23. The 92nd (Highland) and 93rd (Highland) regiments
were raised and placed on the establishment of the army, the
former on the 3rd May, 1796, and the latter on the 25th
August, 1800.</p>

<p>24. The <em>Scots Brigade</em> was numbered the <em>Ninety-fourth</em>
regiment on the 25th December, 1802. This corps had been
formed in the year 1568, for service in Holland against the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55a"></a>[55]</span>
oppression of Spain. Being a British corps, its services were
demanded from the United Provinces by King James II. on
the rebellion of the Duke of Monmouth in 1685, after the
suppression of which it returned to Holland. It again embarked
for England with the Prince of Orange at the Revolution
in 1688. It remained in Great Britain until the Protestant
cause had been established, and it re-embarked for
Flanders in 1691, and served in the campaigns of King
William III. It remained in the service of Holland until
1793, when it was decided by King George III., upon the
application of the British officers remaining in it, to require
the corps to return to Great Britain. It was taken on the
British Establishment on the 5th July, 1793. It then consisted
of <em>Three</em> battalions; in 1795 it was reduced to <em>Two</em>
battalions, and embarked for Gibraltar. In 1796 it was
formed into <em>One</em> battalion, and proceeded to the Cape of Good
Hope. It embarked, in 1798, for the East Indies, from
whence, after much distinguished service, it returned to England
in 1808. It, embarked for Cadiz and Lisbon, and served
with great credit in the Peninsular War, from January, 1810,
to July, 1814. It was disbanded at Belfast on the 24th
December, 1818.</p>

<p>25. The <em>Rifle Corps</em>, commanded by Colonel Coote Manningham,
was formed and added to the establishment of the
Army on the 25th August, 1800. On 25th December, 1802,
it was directed to be numbered the <em>Ninety-fifth</em> regiment,
but was taken out of the list of <em>numbered</em> regiments of infantry
on the 6th February, 1816, and directed to be styled
“<em>The Rifle Brigade</em>.” It then consisted of three battalions,
which were distributed at the following stations, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p class="negin7">
1st Battalion.&mdash;6 Companies with the Army of Occupation in France,
and 4 Companies at Shorncliffe.</p>

<p class="negin7">
2nd Battalion.&mdash;6 Companies with the Army of Occupation in France,
and 4 Companies at Shorncliffe.</p>

<p class="negin7">
3rd Battalion.&mdash;10 Companies at Dover. This Battalion embarked for
Ireland in March, 1816. It was disbanded at Birr on
the 24th of November, 1818.</p>

<p>26. The present 94th, 95th, 96th, 97th, 98th, and 99th regiments
were added to the establishment of the Army in the
early part of the year 1824, in consequence of the increased
number of the colonial possessions of the British Empire.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

remaining provisions.

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
